# Tensor2Tensor Reinforcement Learning starter.

The rl package intention is to provide possiblity to run reinforcement
algorithms within Tensorflow's computation graph.

Currently the only supported algorithm is Proximy Policy Optimization - PPO.

## Sample usage - training in Pendulum-v0 environment.

```t2t-rl-trainer```
