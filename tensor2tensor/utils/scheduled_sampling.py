"""Scheduled Sampling.

This module implemented scheduled sampling as described in (Bengio et al, 2015).
The entry points are two functions,

`sequential_scheduled_sampling_for_t2tmodel()`:
  scheduled sampling adapted to instances of T2TModel.

`sequential_scheduled_sampling()`:
  raw implementation of scheduled sampling. May be used independent of T2T.

**WARNING** This code is VERY slow. Its runtime is at least O(n^2) for
sequences of length n. For models with self-attention, its runtime is O(n^3).
