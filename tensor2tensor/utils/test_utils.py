  """Execute the decorated test with and without enabling eager execution.

  This function returns a decorator intended to be applied to test methods in
  a `tf.test.TestCase` class. Doing so will cause the contents of the test
  method to be executed twice - once in graph mode, and once with eager
  execution enabled. This allows unittests to confirm the equivalence between
  eager and graph execution.

  NOTE: This decorator can only be used when executing eagerly in the
  outer scope.

  For example, consider the following unittest:

  ```python
  tf.enable_eager_execution()

  class SomeTest(tf.test.TestCase):

    @test_utils.run_in_graph_and_eager_modes
    def test_foo(self):
      x = tf.constant([1, 2])
      y = tf.constant([3, 4])
      z = tf.add(x, y)
      self.assertAllEqual([4, 6], self.evaluate(z))

  if __name__ == "__main__":
    tf.test.main()
  ```

  This test validates that `tf.add()` has the same behavior when computed with
  eager execution enabled as it does when constructing a TensorFlow graph and
  executing the `z` tensor with a session.

  Args:
    func: function to be annotated. If `func` is None, this method returns a
      decorator the can be applied to a function. If `func` is not None this
      returns the decorator applied to `func`.
    config: An optional config_pb2.ConfigProto to use to configure the session
      when executing graphs.
    use_gpu: If True, attempt to run as many operations as possible on GPU.

  Returns:
    Returns a decorator that will run the decorated test method twice:
    once by constructing and executing a graph in a session and once with
    eager execution enabled.
