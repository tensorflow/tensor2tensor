  """A batching scheme based on model hyperparameters.

  Every batch contains a number of sequences divisible by `shard_multiplier`.

  Args:
    batch_size: int, total number of tokens in a batch.
    max_length: int, sequences longer than this will be skipped. Defaults to
      batch_size.
    min_length_bucket: int
    length_bucket_step: float greater than 1.0
    drop_long_sequences: bool, if True, then sequences longer than
      `max_length` are dropped.  This prevents generating batches with
      more than the usual number of tokens, which can cause out-of-memory
      errors.
    shard_multiplier: an integer increasing the batch_size to suit splitting
      across datashards.
    length_multiplier: an integer multiplier that is used to increase the
      batch sizes and sequence length tolerance.
    min_length: int, sequences shorter than this will be skipped.

  Returns:
     A dictionary with parameters that can be passed to input_pipeline:
       * boundaries: list of bucket boundaries
       * batch_sizes: list of batch sizes for each length bucket
       * max_length: int, maximum length of an example
