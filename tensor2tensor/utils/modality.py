class Modality(object):
  """Abstract Modality class for data transformations.

  An abstract class representing modalities for transforming data to a space
  interpretable by T2T models. It has 4 functions:
  * bottom: called on inputs entering the model.
  * targets_bottom: called on targets entering the model (e.g., the decoder).
  * top: called on model outputs to generate predictions (e.g., logits).
  * loss: called on predictions (outputs of top) and targets.

  For example, think about a modality for images:
  * `bottom` represents the part of the model applied to an incoming image,
    e.g., an entry flow of a convolutional network.
  * `top` represents the top part of a model that is generating images, e.g., a
    PixelCNN network.
  * `targets_bottom` represents the auto-regressive part of the network.  It is
    applied to the already-generated part of an image, which is given to the
    decoder to generate the next part. In some cases, e.g., for text, it is the
    same as the `bottom` function, and that is the default we use. But, e.g.,
    for images, a different function might be needed to regress properly.
  * `loss` would compare the generated image to the target image and score it.
