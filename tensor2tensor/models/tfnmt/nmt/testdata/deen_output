A Republican Strategy to confront Obama ’ s Reselection
Republicans are justifying their policy with the need to combat electoral fraud .
However , the Brennan Center is a myth of a myth that the electoral fraud in the US is less than the number of people killed by the lightning .
The Republicans ’ lawyers in 10 years in the US , incidentally , recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud .
One thing is certain : these new rules will have a negative impact on voter participation
In this sense , these measures undermine the democratic system of the United States
Unlike Canada , the US States are responsible for holding elections in the various states .
In this sense , the majority of American governments have proclaimed new legislation since 2009 , which makes the procedure for registration or the call for a crime more difficult
This phenomenon has become important after the elections of November 2010 , which 675 new Republican representatives in 26 countries could be recorded .
As a result , 180 draft draft laws were introduced alone in 2011 , which limits the exercise of electoral rights in 41 States .
The new electoral laws require that the electorate be presented with a light card and proof of US citizenship .
Moreover , these laws also shorten the time for the temporary vote , the right to be rescited to the electorate , and to the right to vote , for which a court is present .
Before the 2006 elections , no US state required a US state to show a light card .
Indiana was the first state to demand such a claim .
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitution of Indiana in 2008 .
The Republican authorities were eager to extend this practice to other countries .
Over the past two years , they have encouraged in 34 states draft laws to force voters to show a light card .
It is important to note that , unlike Quebec , US citizens do not have a universal card card such as health insurance cards .
In fact , 11 % of US citizens , that is to say 21 million , are not eligible for the light card issued by a government authority .
Moreover , five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a passport .
However , there are often more than a hundred dollars to pay to receive the necessary ID .
The new restrictions are disproportionate to young people , minorities and low-income people .
In fact , 25 % of African-Americans , 15 % of people with a income of less than $ 35,000 , 18 % of citizens over 65 years , and 20 % of the electorate between 18 and 29 years do not have the
That is still sufficient .
The students , who are seen as voters , who are more qualified for democratic candidates , are not allowed to use their own light card to use their own institution .
On the other hand , the same countries allow members of fishing or hunting to choose more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs .
2004 , no federal state asked for a state citizenship certificate .
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a demand .
Since 2011 , a dozen countries have passed legislation demanding that they prove their American citizenship .
These measures are aimed clearly at limiting Hizpanic voices .
It is obvious that two of three Hizpanic voters who prefer democratic party are the two .
Moreover , in eight federal states in 2011 , Republican legislators promoted legislation to abolish the registration of voters on the day of voting .
You also have limited the right of individuals and groups to help those constituents who wish to register .
These restrictions are not without consequences .
For example , the electoral register for the 2004 general elections has contributed to a further 10 million citizens .
The measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of registration of new voters by 17 % compared to 2006 .
Moreover , Republican legislators in five other federal states have adopted legislation aimed at shortening the period for the pre-election vote .
For example , in the 2008 general election in Florida , 33 % of voters who elected in advance were African-Americans , although they only account for 13 % of the federal state
The same applies to the Hizpanan population .
The latter only made 11 % of the electorate , but 24 % of the citizens elected in advance .
By contrast , the wholly-out of 76 % of voters made only 46 % of voters who chose in advance .
Of course , democratic legislators and their supporters have consistently opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters .
Several draft laws have been blocked by the powers of the democratic governor .
The United States General Advisor has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws .
They could partially limit the damage .
For example , only 16 of the 34 states have adopted legislation that requires a light card indication .
However , the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make the exercise of electoral law more difficult .
Democratic critics denounce the party political nature of the laws adopted and they see it as a clear goal to influence the results in the countries that are to be held in 2012 .
A report by the Brennan Center in 2011 shows that those States that adopted these laws , 171 of the 270 votes required to win the Presidency , are required to win .
It is too soon to confirm with certainty that these changes to the electoral system legislation will have a major impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012 .
But one thing is certain : these new rules will have a negative impact on voter participation
In this sense , these measures undermine the democratic system of the United States
Prostate cancer diagnosis : should the test be carried out or not ?
The PSA-Test , in fact , sometimes produces flawed results , with false or incorrect results , which lead to unnecessary medical interventions .
This leads to greater reluctance by the already indecisive men to carry out screening tests .
Should the test be done or not ?
We have taken up the opinion of two medical doctors .
The studies carried out in the USA have had a number of disturbances between the control groups , so it is difficult to interpret this data and give clear recommendations .
Another study , this time from Europe , concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early diagnosis .
This study also showed that after 12 years the probability of formation of metastases by 30 to 40 % is a 30 % higher if no screening is carried out .
I recommend , therefore , that the test should be carried out from 50 years or 40 years , when one has a direct relatives who have already been infected with prostate cancer .
There is also a higher risk in men of afro-American origin
The most important thing is to take the right decision once a cancer disease has been identified .
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent .
Patients must be made to understand the extent of the risk of cancer , by indicating the possible options for which prostate cancer can be treated , if it does not harm quality of life in the long run , and in these cases , it is more likely to be able to take an active role in the disease .
Today , many men in cancer , in which cancer is recognized , do not treat them because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives
They are proposing active monitoring and are offering treatment to them when the disease continues .
It is determined to be the criteria for deciding who should be treated and who does not .
I therefore recommend that the tests be carried out
But most importantly , it is up to your doctor to decide to determine whether or not to be carried out .
In cooperation with the international company for Urology , Movember developed an instrument to assess the advantages and disadvantages of PAT tests .

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately , there is no miracle cure for cancer .
Despite progress in research , the adoption of a healthy way of life remains the best way to reduce the risk to him .
It is estimated that 30 % of cancers could be prevented if all the patients are eating and doing enough .
&quot; If there were no smoking , this value would rise at least to 50 % &quot; , André Beaulieu , spokesperson of Canadian cancer society .
However , it is assumed that about 10 % of cancers are caused by inheritance .
Several remain unexplained .
The fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority for the Canadian Cancer Society , despite the decline in the number of smokers .
Smoking is responsible for 85 % of lung cancer .
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer .
It damages people &apos;s health seriously .
&quot; Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec , &quot; he regrets André Beaulieu .
Tightening data : 10 years after the withdrawal of cigarette , the risk of cancer is reduced by half .
The weight
According to Canadian cancer society , over-weight and obesity also promote outbreak of disease .
They seem to increase the risk of breast , flu , mastom , muffle , and pancreatic cancer and cervical cancer .
&quot; Research shows that regular physical activity is protected during the whole life against flu cancer , &quot; adds to it .
Food
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat .
Too much increases in the risk of becoming a grim or mastommicide .
It should be avoided .
The conservation of meat by smoked , dry or salt can lead to the formation of carcinogens .
&quot; The latter can damage body cells and lead to the development of cancer &quot; , explains it .
Vitamins
In recent years several scientists have examined the connection between vitamins and cancer .
However , the investigations are not conclusive .
According to the Canadian Cancer Society , studies on Vitamin E are inconsistent .
While a study found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer , another one showed an increase .
Vitamin D ’ s effect on cancer has not yet been clearly demonstrated .
Furthermore , Mr Beaulieu stresses how important it is to talk to his doctor about his concerns and his family preoccupation .
&quot; The implementation of a test test does not lead to cancer . &quot;
The Higgs-Boson
The announcement of the most likely discovery of Higgs-Bosons last summer has a certain upshot , and this is good reason .
It is true that this body is not a factor in the mechanism that is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe .
Finally , this is the last particularity , which is the result of the standard model - our best or &quot; least incorrect &quot; statement of the nature and behaviour of the subject - but it has not been observed empiredly .
But for physicists , it is not yet fully certain that this is the Higgs .
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle and that it is very similar to the Higgs-Boson model .
Moreover , this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physic-congress in Kyoto , but there are still data to be fully sure of .
But we still assume that it is about Higgs , because there seems to be a little risk of decepting ourselves and looking at what is going on .
There is an inevitable law in this world , which means that two objects cannot be available at the same place .
It is not possible to violate this rule - and try not to be too strong because you are going to wash .
For even if the particularity is a really strange , the Pauli &apos; s own prohibition is that , in fact , two particles , that are not the same space , can occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same &quot; quantum state &quot; , which is a &quot; state &quot; , and that is the most common .
The physicists share the particles in two categories on this basis
In one corner are the good citizens who are called Fermione and who are eating the Pauli-principle .
And in the other , the bosons , a bit of anarchists , which are not sacred , certainly do not this principle , which means that they can in fact be able to find in the same place at the same time .
The group of the Berkeley Laboratories , which are in fact absolutely astonished by the Berkeley Laboratories , are on the list : the mesons that we are not treating here and the &quot; power particles &quot; , which are spreading the great powers of the nature and which are somehow associated with the Higgs-Boson .
However , it must be stressed here that these bosones are not all such exotic creatures as you might think .
If you are able to read this chronicle , then only thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality : the photon or the &quot; light particle &quot; that is the &quot; Bote &quot; of electromagnetic strength .
If a particle is accelerated or the direction is changed , the electromagnetic field is &quot; interrupted &quot; in this place , in such a way as a pond stone that has been thrown into a pond .
This &quot; disturbing &quot; creates an electromagnetic wave ( light , infrared or ultrasviolet radiation , etc . ) , and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosones &quot; carrier of power &quot; .
Stite Area
The same applies to Higgs-Boson , with the difference that another field , the Higgs field , must be &quot; interrupt &quot; to show this boson .
However , the higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field ; the reactor has to achieve very high energy , a bit comparable with a frozen pond , whose surface could be distrustful only by a very large rock .
This is why a huge number of particles such as CERN are required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a size of 27 km - to achieve such energies .
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass .
In fact , they are not all particles and not all the materials interacting with electromagnetic field .
Some , such as magnets , do so , but others , for example , would not keep a sheet of paper on the fridge
And equally interacting not interact with the Higgs field : those who do , possess a mass , while the others ( as the photo itself ) do not have a mass .
For what these research can be &quot; good &quot; , ask Mrs Plamondon ?
For science , they are the testing of the standard model ( SM ) and they also allow physicians to thoroughly examine any deviations between the observations and predictions of the SM .
There are , moreover , many physicists who hope that such deviations will be found , because the slightest difference is to open a door to a new physics and to plug some holes of the model .
It has to be said that the latter is still very flawless , because there is no explanation for gravity ( ups ! ) and dark matter , which provides about 80 % of the universe &apos;s dimensions ( again ! ) .
However , such deviations have not been found to date at CERN

The effects of these research on the general population are more difficult to predict , but it would be wrong to assume that there are no
Incidentally , in the early 60s , the pioneers in the photograph of the artists did not assume that their work would trigger such a revolution .
They saw scientific applications , but nothing else .
In fact , we have been working on the late physicists of the Bell Boyle , who was in the Bell Labs in the 1960 ’ s , and in 1962 , even the first permanent laser laser ( the first one was pulpulst ) , already said that the laser was considered to be a &quot; laboratory game &quot; at the beginning .
Imagine ...
Moreover , applications can also be created from all the instruments that are surrounded by research
For example , Willard Boyle in 1969 developed a small Lightensor while his work in the optics
Although it was not the original purpose , this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as an “ eye ” and has brought it to the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009
Of course , this does not mean that the LHC ’ s activities necessarily will change our lives , but it means that you can never know ...
Prepare the best way to die ... &#124; Le Devoir ...
With her Committee on Genetics , Quebec recently discussed the thorny issue of life .
The debate must be resumed soon , although a draft law is being prepared .
However , there is still a great deal to be done in this area
Le Devoir has tried to look closer to this .
A couple of weeks ago Mr L. still lived in his apartment in Montérégie .
The Prostate cancer , who had enrolled him , left him a two-year period .
&quot; I have been living in the city of Beloeil , in the middle of the last years , I was in the middle of a dream , &quot; he said , &quot; he said , &quot; he said , &quot; he said , &quot; he said , &quot; I was a little bit
&quot; But it &apos;s always a shock , you can &apos;t be prepared , &quot; he says .
The disease is doing its work : an insignificant weakness prevents him from going alone on the toilet and even eating herself .
On the table before a delicious lunch , he is perverted to help with eating .
He is even able to smile him and talk to the strangers who are busy to care for him , to provide him with his medicine and to provide him with a bath .
The courage of ordinary death .
&quot; My greatest wish is to heal my diarrhea , because this is humiliating , &quot; he shares .
Some hours later the team found a cure for this evil .
&quot; In the course of our life we learn that a man pink in the Stings &quot; , tells Pierre Brodeur , psychologist in Heim Victor-Gadbois .
To return to the childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for some people .
&quot; This depends on the person &apos;s ability to take a step back , he sets a back .
Because , according to several people who work in pallitional care , great events are taking place in these regrets .
Patients who are exposed to the Treatment Victor Victor Gadbois are all suffering cancer .
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months .
At this stage , they are no longer overblown by the doctors and nurses who care for them , and are not so familiar with so-called &quot; healing &quot; care .
For Mrs A. , 89 years , the worst fear is &quot; consciously and by stemming &quot; .
But by the disease I really got to know my children .
&quot; I have good children , add it .
&quot; I have no wish to live in life , &quot; she says before she accepts her to be a mask that helps her breathe .
It will still be waiting for a last visit to Italy in the next few days .
In the Heim Victor-Gadbois you can also enjoy a group of volunteers and help with food .
The pallitization is used when there are no other possibilities .
To make the death more pleasant .
Quebec is a bed of pallitional care on 11.700 inhabitants .
That is very little , when one takes into account that one day we will all die
The life is continued in the best possible conditions , and Dr. Christiane Martel , one of the health-care workers , is one of the healers
At level of physical , emotional or spiritual comfort .
The older person will be given a gift with Brandy or Pepsi if desired .
Diabetics must no longer control their blood sugar levels .
And death is part of everyday life .
Last night we served Mr X a beer that died during the night .
This morning his son will be the beer at the foot of the outbreak .
&quot; We help both relatives and patients alike &quot; , reports care advisorin Nathalie Savard .
In the Heim Victor-Gadbois is not a day like the other
In addition to an old man , who is a family house , who is being given the pride of being in the farm , and is being given a good deal of pride , he dies , and is a young man , who is dying to survive , and to survive a young man of 36 years , who are a young man , his wife and his two little children , to
&quot; For six months , three to five people have always been with cancer patients at the age of 45 , &quot; says Dr. Christiane Martel .
53 % of the patients identified in the Heim Victor-Gadbois are home to their home , 47 % come from the hospital .
Problem of access to pallitional care
It is said that 77 % of Canadians have no access to Pallitional care , that is to say to care to alleviate patients ’ suffering , when the latter has reached the final stage of their lives , both at home , in hospital and in a nurse .
And several organisations , such as the Heim Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Homedical Care in the Large Room Montreal , specialise more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients .
This is the great inadequacy of health care , which is why many in Palliual care care for specialists to adopt a law on the regulation of euthanasia and asset-assisted adolescents .
Since October October , a manifesto has been signed in circulation by prominent personalities of pallitional care such as Dr. Balvier Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe , to express their opposition to such an initiative .
Dr. Christiane Martel says that the health system of Quebec is not capable of making sure that all right to high-quality pallitional care before accepting to go to the doctor is allowed to go beyond .
Recently , she says she saw a patient who had 14 days with great pain in the emergency , without having taken action to alleviate it .
I fear that patients will only die because they are not receiving adequate health care .
And , at the same time , several oncologists treat their patients , despite the worst predictions , last day
Hélène Richard ’ s survival prospects were already minimal , when she broke a laborious chemotherapy .
When I told my Onkologin that I will break the treatment , she told me that she was sorry to be up to the fight , she told her .
But she told me that I was in the end !
No Omnipotte Care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 % of patients who have asked to die , to die from care staff , have not given this wish , after their pain has been prevented by a team of palliticians .
However , it must be stated clearly that pallitional care is not a mystite in pain treatment .
After Elsie Monereau , head of Pallitional care of the family of the homelands of the Great Montreal Montreal , 8 % of patients are not talking about pain treatment .
The physicians often resurrect the date of their death , which is often used to prevent the patient from being able to sleep in a physical or permanent manner until his death .
We can no longer do so as if we do not perceive that side of the suffering
Patients without pain reduction will have an increasingly common ability to back this date .
Patients whose pain are not being prevented say all the same sentence : &apos; I shall die &apos; .
But that does not necessarily mean , &apos; I want to be involved in the right , but I want to be prevented from being disabled &apos; .
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalist ’ s scholarship on Canadian health research institutions .
Real scale scale in Quebec
The construction of the construction houses , companies of the construction , money supply of political parties and specialists of Italian mafia , tell each day what they know about a great &quot; system &quot; , in the construction industry , civil servants , politicians , trade unionists and mafia .
An industry that was very expensive for the taxpayers of Quebec , especially in the 1990s and 2000 .
&quot; It is strange how the system is broken since it has taken drastic measures , &quot; says Jacques Duchesneau , Member of Quebec and former head of the League of Montreal .
The scandal was revealed by an in-depth investigation into the untrustworthiness of the contracts on road construction in Quebec , which the then prime minister had reluctantly agreed to .
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry , secret financing of parties and bribery of officials .
&quot; Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010 , he said &quot; would only save a billion dollars on the contracts to the contracts &quot; , because some are doing their instinct to receive their share !
The Charbon Neau-Commission has already brought two mayors to the &quot; case &quot; , in the hope that it will succeed in &quot; showing the tactics behind individuals &quot; .
A permanent anti-corruption unit in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit , launched in 2011 , is also making a major effort with its military , agents and analysts .
The police forces of the &quot; Marteau Force &quot; , which has since been brought to the attention of the &quot; Marteau force &quot; of the &quot; Kanalisationskartell &quot; of Montreal in the artificial
Over the past weeks , it has carried out a series of house surveys and accused of fraud and corruption against municipal mandates such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte , the mayor of a suburb .
The next list is Gilles Vaillancourt , who has just resigned from his post as Mayor of Laval , the third largest city of Quebec .
He is suspected of having repeatedly taken off bargaining money in exchange for public contracts .
The engineers of the Montreal street building , and entrepreneurs of Italian origin , such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito , were particularly acclaimed .
The latter has been uplifting by the Commission &apos;s use of the &quot; system &quot; to maintain public contracts .
He himself has paid 3 % of the value of the contracts in Montreal , which he has received to a Mafia broker , who transferred money to the Union of Montreal , the Mayor of the City of Gérard Tremblay .
Mr Zambito has in the 2000s played his hand in the game by spending more than 88.000 Canadian dollars ( about 68.000 euros ) to provincial parties , especially those who were liberated in power .
He also decided to organise illegal allocation of funds to the former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau .
Session contracts , whose costs were artificially inflated .
In Montreal , the &quot; system &quot; of corruption was functioning smoothly .
The former engineer of the project , the former construction engineer of the Commission , has been in a position to deal with this issue in detail : in ten years , invitations to travel , golf tournaments , restaurants and ice hockey games , as well as compensation amounting to 736,000 dollars , as a return to the
Other civil servants of the road construction company admitted that they could swallow themselves by artificially inflating the invoices by 30 % .
Furthermore , a mayor of the Mayor of the City of Mayor , Martin Dumont , accused Mr Tremblay that he deliberately overlooked a shadow budget that filled his coffers with black money .
Following these revelations , Mr Tremblay resigned in early November , which seemed to be a serious crisis in Montreal .
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal to put the alarm .
As mayor of Rivière-des-Prairies , in the East of the island , she refused to sell a municipal property from 2010 to buy 5 million dollars and to sell to 1,6 million builders in the booming property market .
70 % Unemployment in the Campaign
The investigation , which is being carried out , is , in fact , being carried out by the investigation of a thread which allows the functioning of the system undermined by Ameisen to stop the evil and to denounce the guilty .
She says that the procedure is &apos; painful but positive &apos; .
We are in the process of snoozing the wounds , but we need a single investigation unit , and an oversight to prevent a return to questionable practices .
How to clean .
Regularly
Jacques Duchesneau , on the one hand , noted that &quot; officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars , but above all , they are thinking about the role of the &apos; mandates who are on the table &apos; when they were not involved in fraud !
Based on a 70 % black money in financing the campaigns in Quebec , he said : &apos; I have been told that this is a weak and bad reality . &quot;
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to the US $ 100 , which , according to him , would not change the situation , &quot; as long as the campaign campaign is not strictly limited , it will be a matter of policy to keep money in
It recommends a complete review of the system for awarding public contracts and financing the parties : &apos; we cannot go deeper ; by using the courage to do things , we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more control and laws . &quot;
If this history damages the international standing of Quebec and that of Montreal , Mr Duchesneau asks those who laugh to throw a glance in their own backyard ...
&quot; PSG is not the FC Barcelona ! &quot;
This season , you have adopted a new scale with PSG .
How do you explain this progress ?
You can explain it through a personal insight , but also through the new dimension of the PSG .
Great players have come .
I am making progress every day .
The staff were very friendly and helpful .
These elements stimulate me daily to improve my level of play .
And in a game , this is even easier
In football , everything is fast .
But I do not go into the eye .
Since I started the preparation of the INF Clairefontaine training , until I was in my time at Saint-Etienne , I have progressed gradually .
They are therefore taking advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti ...
The new summer season is used to playing games very high .
You also know that every training is crucial .
This leads to a player like me who must have the stir and do his best .
In addition , Carlo Ancelotti gives me much of my playing position .
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele , who played the same position as me .
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job ?
Of course
Ancelotti is a great fan of all the technicians
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1 and it is one of the best trainers in Europe .
He has a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs .
He had contact with big players .
I think it will win further titles in Paris .
In January I had an encouraging conversation with him .
I had a break from a injury series .
The confidence he has set in me is also a statement of my achievements .
What do you think about the first part of the season ?
In Ligue 1 , Lyon took us the place of the top .
We are , however , in the backyard
One of our most important goals is the Champions League : we have qualified for the Achtelfinale .
What is the objective of the association in this competition ?
We will try to get as far as possible .
From now on everything is possible .
However , we will be very good European teams to help us .
First , we want to be the first of our group before Porto , so that we can defeat the back of the Achtelfinas as a home game
Can the PSG be a great European club in the short run
It has already the budget for this ...
To become a great European club , Paris has to win title and to make a name in the long run
This is not the case today .
The funding of PSG is the means to take concrete forms .
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in Ligue 1 , as was the case last season ?
Of course , this would be a great disappointment
This year , it is really our hearts to give this title to us .
We were very busy in the last season .
We were disappointed in May , because we were strong enough to win the victory .
We finished the season with a very strong performance .
We have completed 79 points .
Normally , you should be a master of 79
But another team , those of Montpellier , has achieved an even better season .
I believe this year is the right thing .
Even though the great teams such as Marseille , Lyon or Bordeaux are heading for the title , I think we have the witness to winning it .
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG ?
Given what has been invested and the players we have , it is normal that much of us are expected to do so .
We accept that perfectly .
But if we win a home match against Troyes 4-0 , and we still find something to be done , this is certainly a frustrating thing .
One wonders what people are waiting for .
We could never win every weekend with 4-0 .
We are not the FC Barcelona !
We are trying to set up a game of play
A team is building up with time .
We have proven strength in the Champions League .
Look at Manchester City , an association of two seasons , not to qualify for the Achtelfinals , and also to have huge expenses !
With regard to the invested sums , you thought you had a chance to play a break with 15 points !
This would be to say that our opponents and the French champions would be left out .
The new PSG &quot; boostet &quot; was not good in the last season .
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting .
I hope that in May we will be the smarter victors and tell us that we have finally won them , despite all the difficulties .
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic .
So much to talk about a &quot; Zlatan-dependence &quot; .
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and is shooting many doors .
He has come to the top of the list and is a star of Ligue 1 .
Everywhere he played , he has shown that he is a great player and a world star .
We respect both the player and the person in the team .
He also respects the people that surrounds him .
What has happened is truly exceptional .
This stimulates the others to improve their level of play .
Thiago Silva , which is one of the best defenders in the world , makes it possible for everyone else to make progress
How did you experience the Championships with the French national team ?
How disappointing .
It was my heart to participate in this EM .
Unfortunately , my violation prevented me from breaking a little game time .
I have seen things where I have been stronger .
Today I can make good games in the national team .
This has been my hope since my baptism with the &quot; Bleus &quot; .
We have learned what has happened in Ukraine , and we must show some exemplary behaviour today .
What do you think of the first months of Didier Descues at the top of the &quot; Bleus &quot;
He has achieved promising results .
We have a good position in the Qualification Group for the World Cup
The national trainer is strict , is close to the players and is encouraging to win .
Like Laurent Blanc .
But I do not want to compare .
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM .
I hope that Didier DesKlus will lead the &quot; Bleus &quot; to Brazil .
Does the Undecisidian Undecisidian Act ( 1 : 1 ) in Spain are a prelude to play ?
This game has given us confidence .
Everyone has been used for all others .
Before this meeting in Spain I had never seen a comparable game in my career .
With Bitcoin , Payment and Buy without Bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks , identified transactions and administrative charges between the parties involved .
Moreover , as often in these technologies , a political vision is tangible : the conviction that the current monetary system , designed by banking monopolies , leads to financial crises .
In fact , the Bitpit created by Satoshi Nakamoto ( a Pseudonym ) is both a virtual currency ( in dollars , Euro , etc . ) and a protocol for secure exchange such as BitTorrent , which allows direct exchange of files .
15,000 computers in the network already account for about 200,000 transactions .
Some thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as payment funds .
After the match of Bitcoin reached a maximum of 30 dollars ( 23 euros ) , he fell to 2 dollars a month later , to 2 dollars before he recovered to around 10 dollars ( the courses are listed on the Bitcoincharts.com website ) .
Nothing particularly different from the world of world trade in real currencies or financial products .
Yet the European Central Bank ( ECB ) has shown interest in a report on virtual currencies published in October .
She describes Bitcoin as &quot; the virtual currency with the greatest success &quot; , &quot; in competition with the dollar or euro &quot; and &quot; similar to traditional currencies &quot; .
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies such as &quot; Credits &quot; , which are used to make progress in a video game that you can win or buy ( and sometimes exchange ) .
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system .
However , every time the trade is monitored and processed by a central authority
With Bitcoin , all network nodes simultaneously cover the invoices of the invoice , auditors , money issuers , and buyers and vendors
How does this network work ?
Each transaction between two users is actually taking place between two email addresses in the form of an email
With the difference that the user can choose another address for each payment , which ensures anonymity .
A number of data related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double encryption system .
This way the network can check the authenticity of the transaction .
The content of the file is also possible to ensure that the traged bitcoins are available in the public accounts of the public accounts widely used throughout the network .
The decisive step is to add this new transaction to this book .
This is done on a mathematical task that is started on computers , with the winner who is a kind of premeditate central banker who has the privilege to add this extra line .
This is a mess of the file , i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint .
The computer &quot; take &quot; the new transaction and add a number before the whole &quot; chicken &quot; .
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint ( many nulls at the beginning ) .
If this number is found , the other knots can check for the correct .
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions and any modification would change fingerprinting .
If a user is to pay a very fast ( less than 10 minutes ) to the same money , only one of the two transactions will be validated by the network and the other will remain without interlinking , as both have different fingerprints .
The computer that has solved the task has 50 bitcoins .
To prevent inflation , this reward is regularly halved , probably before the end of 2012 .
The Bitcoins are thus limited to 21 million but are still part of a 100 millionstel , which leaves a certain amount of space to be used ...
In addition , the difficulty of the task is increased with every improvement in computing power
The life of the network has already had ups and downs .
The web pages that provide the services for bitcoins were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits stolen .
&quot; The weak point does not concern the actual protocol &quot; , Pierre Noizat , who has just introduced Payment , has introduced a company for payment with real money and uses Bitcoin &apos;s network .
The ECB also reports about the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service .
However , cash also has these shortcomings .
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind
Other people such as the blog blog WordPress will accept them .
Recently Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron , the Weizmann Institute in Israel , analyzed the accounting book and showed that almost 80 % of the bitcoins are not in circulation .
A &quot; Mega-Finder &quot; started in November .
&quot; Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged &quot; , Jon Holmquist is working for the Coinabul company , which converts Bitcoins into gold .
Pierre Noizat , who is also a writer of a book about this currency , firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network
Its system Paytunia is equivalent to a credit card ( with real money ) or a non-contact payment with a mobile phone , but Bitcoin uses the validation of transactions that are cheaper .
The owner is also managing his identity and can remain anonymous .
The system can be easily implemented with traders , and the latter must not install new terminals or computer programs .
You just need to give a address that can be &quot; photographed and recognized &quot; by a phone , Pierre Noizat will assure you that he has thousands of users .
It is a general trend , which revisions the hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems .
&quot; It will take some time to get bitch but , in 2013 , a turning point is forecast .
The ECB , in its report , is in fact proposing to reassess the various risks to a successful currency in the event of a success of this currency
We are being withdrawn from Afghanistan .
And afterwards ?
French troops have their responsibilities in Afghanistan ( Kapisa and Surobi ) .
NATO and the US should follow the end of 2014
It is time for the Afghan army to take over its territory again and to allow the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us .
We have , in particular , punished Afghan farmers by being terrorists .
And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers , and the injured and the divers .
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists , former leaders who are fleeing Pakistan , but also from farmers who are refusing to hold armed foreign presence , as they are at the time of the Soviets .
They want to defend their centuries of ancient and archaic traditions , even though they have joined jihadists , Pakistani , Arabs , Uzbeks and Shirts .
The fact that the local insurgents are supported by local insurgents will no longer be there if the western countries are to be disposed
The withdrawal of French troops from the base in Nijrab , which I watched from a hill planted with mandous trees , which was financed by French loans , has been properly implemented .
The trucks and tank convoys survived by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked .
There will be no entry into Kabul at the end of 2014 .
The conditions have changed since the incontrovertible advance of 1994 to 1996 .
At that time Kabul and the country were overtaken by war due to the struggles of the various revolt groups
Their power was then seen as a kind of liberation and return to security .
Afghan women have paid the price of the obscurantism paid by the Al-Qaeda organisation , but their situation has not improved up to now .
Former Mujaheddin , the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position .
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war have come to power in 2001 .
They turned into business , by confusing the government ’ s basic powers to sell them to the country to the refugees from Iran and Pakistan , and to gain the benefits of massive US suborders .
They have been discredited , and most of them were not involved in the battles .
As I heard in the campaigns , people want a government that is not composed of divisions .
Many young people want to leave the country , just as those who could benefit from American subsidies : capital flight is a considerable one .
Young people have been living up to war and ideologies .
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan they had contact with the modern world and enjoyed their advantages .
About 65 % of the population is under 25 years ; Kabul has 5 million inhabitants , which is a fifth of the population .
In cities , the public schools are full of girls like boys .
These young people , who are not going to be able to return to the obscurantism of the former parties , nor to the corruption of some executives
All , including armed parties , are obsessed with mobile phones ; television with its Turkish series , which are a modern world , is being looked at everywhere .
A army is now there .
Will the authorities under whose command will be considered legitimate ?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militias in the province , which are being removed from central government power .
Afghanistan , the country of mountains with strong local identities , should have benefited from some decentralisation , but by abolishing the prime minister , since the constitution of 1964 , the US was seeking to make the US a centralized state with a strong presidential power .
President Karzai does not want foreign controls , especially on the elections planned for April 2014
However , his country has long been dependent on foreign aid for the 1950s and years .
Industrial goods were not rebuilt , functional dust plants are not there and important irrigation systems have not been repaired .
Everything is imported ; except fruit and vegetables , nothing is produced .
The private initiative is given priority .
In a country which was founded 30 years ago , State control of infrastructures would have been necessary .
The rumour has been that Afghanistan has huge natural resources .
This is more to the impression that the western countries were only on the ground to seize this .
Without energy to process ice or copper ore on site , or without means of transport for export over the mountains , no mining is possible .
The Chinese have already left Mes Aynak , the largest in the world , and the international archaeologists ( financed by the World Bank ) are making their excavations on the vast Buddhist site , and remain the province &apos;s most important employers .
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan , which are largely dependent on imports and exports , to return normal relations .
The withdrawal of the French combat forces was completed on 20 November .
The new cooperation treaty provides for continued traditional aid : Girchen- and Jungengymnasi, , Institut für French at the Universities , French Institute , Cooperation in the Military , Legal , Medicine and Agriculture , support of the Archaeological delegation
Since 2009 , a service of &quot; civil-military actions &quot; has been set up in order to help the reorganisation of the agriculture sector in dozens of charitable villages , in dozens of charitable projects and measures to restore agriculture , to conduct a small French non-governmental organisation to try to &quot; gain &quot; the &quot; hearts and minds &quot; and to achieve the impossible task of concocting and offensive activities .
This work , which has been necessary for many local workers , has helped to suppress the uprising : irrigation , wells , drinking water , reforestation , fruit trees , soil protection and increased agricultural land .
What souvenir is we withdrawing from USD 2 billion after military expenditure
A much more modest budget will help to improve the living conditions that are often very hard in these valleys , which are more than 2000 metres .
In the message , dozens of written requests by small agricultural projects were addressed by municipalities of the province of Kapisa
To allow farmers to escape from the insurmountable insurers , which their own statements are , it would be less , well controlled and , in the interests of civilian aid , be well controlled .
A Constitution with the Brezhstange in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi .
Egypt , in terms of constitutional declaration , which temporarily grants him unlimited powers , more than ever , has decided to put everything on a map .
On Wednesday , he announced on Wednesday that the constitutional assembly will be adopting its final version on Wednesday .
Just a week ago , the Head of State granted two additional months to complete his work .
Egypt has , for almost two years , now been building a temporary , multi-pronged text , which weakens institutional stability and leads to a legal breakthrough .
This new initiative has only made it more divided .
For his opponents , the president stubbornly withstood his &quot; autocratic delirium &quot; by continuing to &quot; break his word &quot; and &quot; the right to go &quot;
On the part of its supporters , it is assured that it is a way to stop the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and accelerate the transition process
A referendum should be held in 14 days .
A very short period that forces the brothers to abandon their intentions to explain the text of the section for section .
It is also a way for the President to rediscover its public and democratic legitimacy , while the protests are raging throughout the country .
After confirming in an interview with the American weekly newspaper , Mohamed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably .
So , with this rebellion on an overwhelming vote , the Egyptian people are being asked to take an ultimatum : &apos; I do not agree with my draft or I keep the full power , &quot; the latter should be called upon to end the Constitution .
85 mostly Islamist members of this constitutional assembly yesterday adopted the text in a strange atmosphere .
The majority of Liberals did not meet the call .
Shortly before the constitutional declaration in November , they turned out to be abused , because they felt they were unable to assert their views .
Human rights organisations , religious minorities and civil society have acted equally .
In the wake of the decision , the 11 people , deputy members , were added yesterday .
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly approved unanimously .
The commentators , however , were entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day ... the time for prayer was expressed , because some members of the panel felt that the Pendelu ’ s Pendel was not exactly the same .
The text which was passed last night is based on 234 articles .
Article 2 , which draws attention to all of them , remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and states that &apos; the principles of Sharia are the main source of justice &apos; .
The Salafist parties , which are an important demand for the establishment of Islamic law , had hoped to replace &apos; the principles &apos; by &apos; the rules &apos; , which would have made it possible to apply a more rigorous application
For the Islamists , the fact that this article has not been changed proves to be a proof of its good will and respect for the other members of Egyptian society .
&quot; hypocrisy &quot; trusts the liberals , who are only seen as propaganda .
For they are told that the constitution is being Islamised by other articles
They are in particular in Article 220 , which recognises the University of Al-Azhar an advisory function , particularly in relation to the review of conformity with the laws of Sharia .
According to the Egypt-German student , Sophie Pommier , this is worrying , because the people who are asked to give opinions have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy .
One can see the first signs of a theocracy .
Liberals are also worried about the fact that the next Rector of this university will be far less moderate than the current one .
&quot; At present , there is no concrete religious commitment .
This Constitution is a constitution that we are maintaining .
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema , but academics , who are trained in the French system , are invited to the city of Alexis Blouet , who writes a thesis on Egyptian constitutional order .
However , he acknowledges that there can be a ambiguity in Article 220 , as the concepts used are opposed to the religious vocabulary .
The first is the &quot; Fiqh &quot; &#91; Islamic jurisdiction , Anm . Red , &#93; .
And in the future , the question of how civil judges are competent to decide on this issue could be raised .
In addition to its religious aspect , the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised for the far-reaching powers that it grants to the President of the Republic
The Muslim Brothers argue that they are significantly reduced compared with the former regime .
Another point of conflict : the powers of the army
In line with the military &apos;s wish , the review of the defence budget will not be presented to Parliament , but to a national defence council .
There will also be no ban on civil trials in military courts , as the associations of defence of human rights have demanded .
The latter also share their concerns about the text they consider to be a freedom of liberties .
The blasphemy of blasphemy is maintained , and insults are now banned , which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression , especially for the press .
In addition , no article refers more to the protection of women , underscores the death of Human Rights Watch by Lewis
In my opinion , the only positive point is the ban on torture by Article 37 .
This word was not included in the previous Constitution .
The Egyptian President had to speak on television yesterday evening , demonstrations for this afternoon .
The supporters of the State Scoreboard will march Saturday .
In Israel , Ukrainian tourists expect sacred sites , the nails of the world and a sea of Sole .
The land of Gelobland combines the glory of biblical truths , modern comfort and an untouched nature .
AIF gives you the five most important reasons for visiting Israel .
Forests in the Holy Sites
Visit the River Jordan , where Jesus was baptized .
It means that all who are swimming in this river receive God ’ s blessing .
Galiläa is the place where Jesus has made his miracle : the transformation of water to wine on a wedding , walking on the water , the depression of the lake and fishing .
Jesus was also a great man of the Great Testament .
Most of the holy , however , are found in Jerusalem
The king of Jesus Christ , and the Cross of Jesus Christ , make this a journey .
The path begins at the Roman fortress Antonia , Pretorium , where the court was , and through the streets of the Old Town , it was the tomb of Golgotha , where the Cross , the Salation stone and the tomb of Jesus are located .
Here , a Christian view of the world is being formed , symbolizing the savoury of humanity .
The Holy Cross of Jerusalem is on the spot where a Christian legend grew to grow the tree from which the Cross was made for the Cross of Jesus .
In Jerusalem is also the most sacred place of the Jewelry - the Caverns , the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD .
Traditionally , people are leaving people with different beliefs of faith , who will then be fulfilled .
A Journey
The ruins of the fortress Massada form the remains of secret forests against enemies , which built the Great of Great in 25 AD for his family .
They are on a rock wall in the mountains 450 meters above sea level .
Only mountain climbers can reach the ruins by their own strength .
All others are leading a glimpse of this historic summit .
In the north of the country in 1600 to 2040 metres , the famous ski resort Hermon is attracting countless tourists in the winter months .
The river is also accessible by a shuttle bus .
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometres .
According to a legend , there were allegedly pagan gods at the mountain summit
Unique Museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country .
All of them are not possible to visit .
But at least the five most interesting of them should be allowed to visit .
This is the most important area of the island .
There are ancient Qumranros or Scrolls of the Death Sea found in Felshöhlen in the Judaetian desert , and some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits are being found .
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth visiting .
There is the collection of works of Impressionists and Expressionists Monet , Pissaro , Renoir , Cézanne , Sisley , Matisse , Modigliani , Chagall and Picasso .
In Akko you can visit the Museum in Bad Al Basha , which has several halls of ancient Turkish baths , with sculptures by the then visitors and bathing establishments .
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum , where you can admire sculptures by Dali and Rodin .
There is neither a museum guide nor souvenir shops .
The admission is free , and donations are not accepted .
The fifth museum , the Holocaust Museum and Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv , is one of the most dramatic chapters of history .
The most important department is the monument for children , which was built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in concentration camps and chambers of gas .
When entering the room there is total darkness .
Stars radiate .
And they are the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died .
Ukraine is also mentioned there .
A Health
The three most important recreational areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean , Red Sea and the dead Sea .
There are swimming pools , water parks , dolphin and ocariums on each of the three places .
Amaadly , the Red Sea is also being damaged in the winter months , as water temperatures are not below 21 ° C and air is warming to 23 ° C.
The dead sea is even more heated and it is all well below the year .
This unusual sea , with a surface of 417 metres below sea level , is the most deepest sea in the world .
Its turquoise waters have a high salt content and thus even un-boilers are easily on the surface
The surrounding landscape is indescribable .
Visitors come here to treat the skin ( natural salt and healing sludge ) , and to treat skin inflammation , allergies , asthma , eczema , arthritis , bronchitis , strain and to relieve strain nerves .
The Secrets of the Age
The city is also home to the old town of Tel Aviv , the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean
This city was dominated by the famous sea path , Egypt , Syria , Anatolia and Mesopotamia .
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends .
According to the legend , Noah built his arche here , and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda , which he had a long and happy life in this place .
Visitors are happy to climb through the narrow streets named after star characters .
The legend is to be the legend after all the races that touch the walls of the cup with their star characters .
In Jaffa you can recomend newcomers from all over Israel and even other countries in photo sequences .
In Caesarea , the city of King Herodes , you can stroll through the Roman theater and conquer the fortress of the Crusades .
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city of Judoba and residence of Roman statesman , including Pontius Pilatus .
The theatre is currently being renovated and is currently being redecorated .
Tourist List
If you are travelling to Israel , don &apos;t worry about your poor English skills : about 30 % of the Israelis speak Russian .
The money is not taken into a Euro , but in dollars , which can be easily changed into Schekel ( current exchange rate : $ 1 dollars to 3.8 schellers ) .
The city is also the main tourist attraction of the city , but in the city there is also a quick train and in Haifa the only underground line of the country with six stations connecting the suburbs with the Upper City .
It is an underground and underground railway .
A journey within the city costs 6 sellers , which is sufficient to travel to the city by up to 1.5 hours .
According to Jewish tradition , the Sabbat is celebrated in Israel on Saturday .
From Friday to Saturday , the markets and business are closed and public transport is closed .
And on Sunday morning the week begins .
In many cafés , restaurants and restaurants , there is only cooked food , which includes pork meat , seafood , fish , fish , and food , which includes both dairy and meat products .
Instead , you can choose between different dishes with hammel and beef , soup and desserts , traditional Jewish lobushoods , various sauces , various sauces , fried beans , fried beans and beans , and fruits and vegetables .
There are no troublesome dogs in the streets of Israeli cities .
There are many well-preserved cats , which are unrivalled by the streets .
In the evening , they are even sleeping on the rooftop cars .
The cats may be busy places and do not say no to pizza shops .
A car is charged between 37 dollars per day ( Hyundai Getz ) up to 188 dollars ( Audi A6 , Volvo S80 ) .
The insurance costs an additional 15 dollars per day
And bicycle rental costs 15 Schekel per day .
Tickets for museums cost 30 Schekel .
In figures
In 2012 , more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel .
Most adventurous and recreational people came from Russia , France , Germany , Italy , England , the US and Ukraine .
From January to October 2012 , 118,8,800 Ukrainian tourists came into the country , which , compared to the comparable period , will be an increase of 51 % in 2010 , before the visa requirement is lifted on 9 February 2011 .
&quot; The great and powerful &quot; leads to Moscow : migrants save money for language .
While Members and civil society are discussing the usefulness of the law on compulsory language tests for migrants , criminals are already carrying out counterfeiting certificates .
Every year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow , Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia .
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia : Uzbekistan , Tajikistan and Turkmenistan .
Their only aim is to earn money to keep families remaining in their homeland .
On 1 December , a law in force , which stipulates that each working class must be a test , must be certified by the Russian language .
This regulation is currently only for migrants , who want to work in the services sector , in the local housing sector and in retail markets
However , the tests under the Federal Ministry of Migration should be compulsory in future for all host workers .
We must not only be testing language tests , but also testing and the bases of legislation .
Language skills must be proven both for the preservation and renewal of the work permit .
Exceptions are only valid for citizens of countries in which Russian is a language
This law also exempts people who have received their training certificates and diplomas before the USSR in 1991 .
The Right , Problems and Protection of Rights
The entire test centre will be held under the aegis of the Puschkin Institute of Russian Language , Russian University of Ukraine , Moscow State University , the Sankt Petersburger Staats-Universität and other Russian universities .
Migrants can leave the tests in all cities ; already more than 160 centres in Russia have already opened up .
The initiative to introduce the tests has been supported by the representatives of the State Duma and the Federal Ministry of Migration
On the other hand , civil rights activists asked about the law in the press several times : what is the whole thing
What changes do the rules need to have to show language skills , both for the Russians and for the host workers ?
Above all , the Minister for Migration , who has chosen to be responsible , is to reduce the number of forced workers .
&quot; Many are now talking about the protection of workers &apos; rights &quot; , says the head of the Federation &apos;s representative of the Transatlantic Migration Authority in Tajikistan , Viktor Sebelew
However , their rights must be protected before their departure .
Only organised recruitment will solve 90 % of the problems of foreign workers .
Migrants encounter migrants without a profession , education , language skills and medical care .
It is a good idea that a future immigrant , without knowledge , is expected to meet people with evil intentions , which will be able to meet him on a dark , tight baracke , where he will be able to wear a few months without food and documents , and to be able to wear 12 to 14 hours a day .
We are reaching many complaints from our migrants .
&quot; In the home you will be promised and on arrival you are cheated , will get their passports and receive no promised salmon &quot; , the head of the main management of the labour migration to the Tajikistan migration authority , Tolib Schwaripow .
Not shining , boss !
However , many citizens of Central Asian republics , who want to earn their money in Russia , do not only want to make their own language , but they are not able to express their own language in their own language .
Of course , this is not so much blame as the evil : only a few Turkmen , Uzbeks and Takkies can only afford a reasonable basic education .
In their families , there are not even money to feed children , let them eat them decent clothes , shoes and books .
As teenagers , these children are taking the first opportunity to make money .
&quot; It is difficult without language skills &quot; , give them .
&quot; You feel depressed and inferior . &quot;
Civil rights authorities are emphasising the following important aspects .
The test only needs to be done by migrants with legal status
If you do not have this status , there is no audit and therefore no official work
Meanwhile , most of the host workers continue to be illegally in Russia .
&quot; Welcome &quot; or &quot; Enrived for unauthorized persons &quot;
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get official status in Russia .
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and , of course , the linguistic difficulties
The legalization costs money : 12 to 16 thousand roubles .
A falsified registration can be done quickly and only for one and a half thousand
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered , and that is why there are cases of blackmail .
&quot; You want one or two hundred roubles for cigarettes and tea &quot; , the Taskschike Umed Huschkadamow speaks to journalists .
&apos;Do not waste costs for false papers &apos; .
The day when the law came into force , it turned out that not only can the registration documents of migrants be falsified .
Some falsified certificates which certify the completion of the language test have already been seized by staff of the Federal Ministry of Migration .
The falsified papers were printed with a standard colour print .
Of course , the new owners did not get it : every miracle who hoped to save the tests would pay for the document sentausend Rubel .
This is more than twice as much the cost of the official test : this costs a migrant threw three thousand rubles .
The most important immediate task is to protect the system against corruption , so that the certificates can not be bought easily , both officials and civil rights officers are in agreement .
For the moment , the authorities , who are the first to fall through the test , only promise to have time for a language course .
In addition , newcomers without language skills are offered places in areas where there is no need for active understanding with people .
Civil Ministry
Legal Arms of Crime Crimes
The Russian Ministry of Interior plans to tighten up the arms law for private arms owners
The authorities are responding to the latest events : injured in weddings on weddings and seven dead at the mosque of Moscow , Dmitri Winograv .
The police want to ban non-lethal arms in public and to raise the age of 18 years to possession of firearms .
The proposal to the Chairman of the Dua Committee on Security and Crime of Armed Forces , Irina Jarowaja , has supported and promised that the changes to the arms law will be brought forward soon
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities are trying to combat the problems by &apos; attracting screws &apos; .
An open letter has been published on the internet , which the authors of various arms associations call on the authorities to distance themselves from &apos; meaningless tightenings &apos; .
The per capita crime of registered weapons is very low , expressed by the prosecutor , Wasilij Lesnikov , the BBC ’ s Russian service .
According to the Ministry of Home Affairs , 142 crimes were executed with the use of registered weapons in 2012 , while there were 1,168 thousand crimes in the same period .
The authors of the open briefs are convinced that tightening the law on private arms owned criminals will not prevent them from being used on the black market .
At present , the authors can find every possible weapon in Moscow for little money .
Meanwhile , the Ministry of Interior stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control
Suppliers : from factories to officers
The weapons are spread across several channels on the black market
There are five such main channels , one of which is a former grandfather Viktor Baranez , who was in the Ministry of Education and General Staff in ten years
Screenshot of a website that accepts weapons orders .
The first channel is the army or the military , that is arms that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus .
&quot; The weapons were stolen both by Russian officers and by the Caucasus themselves , &quot; says Baranez .
The second channel is to be stolen from illegal weapons , the police officers of criminals .
Baranez explains that weapons are stolen by the police forces and directly by the police forces .
Other illegally sold weapons are derived from military weapons .
Many military camps often exploded .
&quot; There are evidence that , in some cases , fire incitement were to cover the lack of weapons , &quot; says former military personnel .
Baranez also has a contribution to the black market , which is also about arms manufacturers
&quot; Today there are countless private armaments factories that do not stand up to international competition and therefore , the arms of the black market , such as Moscow , are shattered , &quot; reports the expert .
Another channel of the Black Sea is smuggling .
Most of the pistol and armies come from poor countries such as Kirgisien .
&quot; There is a custom , sometimes artisan production , and a mafia that organizes the smuggling , explains the former military members .
Where do they come from ?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels on supply of illegal weapons around the world .
In 2011 a report was drawn up by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Administration .
Experts analyzed the reports by the Ministry of Interior and the Federal Ministry of State statistics , criminal statistics and publicly accessible data on portals on weapons .
The vast majority of illegal weapons are the army and the legal guardian .
Half of all weapons on the black market are there by the &apos; blame of those who have done their work with weapons &apos; , and this is what the report says .
According to researchers , 17 % of arms from conflict areas , 14 % are on theft in arms production , and 5 % are from illegal excavations .
A dealer of a weapon of arms , which is not called to be called , assures that weapons that are found in illegal excavations are not being bought any more , because they are outdated .
It is more common to find that traders are getting to a weapon of arms .
A weapon is bought , for example , a gun of TT .
The weapon is issued and passed through the fence .
&quot; The dealer brings the weapon to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines &quot; , he tells him .
&quot; The police know all too well , and , if they cannot keep the plan for crime uncovered , it is a good thing that they are able to keep up with the routine of purchases of dealers in the traders who are offering illegal weapons
&apos;How in Luxury
The purchaser and the seller are most often familiar with acquaintances
I was looking to see websites and blogs , when someone was watching me and suggested to me to come to the Station &quot; Begowaja &quot; where someone would wait to me , where we could negotiate the price .
I only learned the price of the weapon

&quot; To get a weapon , I need a friend who has contacts , &quot; says the seller , &quot; I have such a friend , but I don &apos;t trust him &quot; .
There are traders on the markets , but there must be a deal with a code like Iwan Ivanwitsch , who makes sure that the daughter has lost a tooth &apos; .
I am even getting some headlines about a friend I trust .
He also gives me the headlines because he knows that I am not blaming it .
Neulinge search for weapons on various ways .
The former military associate Viktor Baranez , in the mid-1990s , tried to be a buyers of illegal weapons when he wrote an article on this subject
The Schemas , according to him , did not change
He got a photographic album , where &quot; all possible &quot; was produced .
&quot; I felt like a luxury lover , &quot; the military members recalled .
The buckle is not getting the cat in the bag , but can try everything .
I as a potential customer do not just buy but go to the Seller with the Seller , and we are putting a target on it .
&quot; I can shoot there and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot , we negotiate with each other &quot; , the expert describes the procedure .
Buy from the Sofa
Search engines show search results on websites and groups in &quot; vcontacts &quot; where weapons are offered for different purposes .
There are neither documents nor personal meetings .
&quot; You only need the appropriate money &quot; , it says in the advertising advertisements on the &quot; Fire pistol or gun &quot; website .
There , users will be asked to submit your orders
Is it also sold to minors ?
&quot; Of course without license &quot; , asks user Iwan &quot; ( verbal quotation ) .
&quot; buy a TT , Moscow &quot; , is the lakonic question of &quot; Fedorenkow &quot; .
The Federal Security Service recently switched to countless shut-sides , and buyers who want to buy arms are getting to the service .
People come to the feed of hungry fish and then land in Siberia and must be slaughtered .
Military commentator and former military representative Viktor Baranez
I heard about the scheme : the site is usually registered abroad , and Russian laws do not apply .
The responsible persons take the orders .
The purchaser transfers money over a bank machine .
&quot; In response to a photo and a description of the weapon &quot; , the press spokesperson of the non-profit organization &quot; Pravo na oryzhie &quot; Dmitrij Kislow .
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that you can eventually run empty and come behind a grid when you are on a website .
The Federal Security Service recently switched to countless shut-sides , and buyers who want to buy arms are getting to the service .
&quot; People are coming to life like hungry fish and then land in the Siberian labour camp and can slay coal , &quot; he says .
A Makarow for USD 100
When buying illegal guns , experts are expected to charge $ 100 to 900 dollars .
According to Dmitrij Kislow of the organization &quot; Pravo na oryzhie &quot; you can buy a polarow of 100 to 300 dollars .
We must wait a year and a half .
The weapon is issued in military weapons storage centres of a middle rank .
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of Interior , the number of offences in the country , which was in fact 7 % from January to October 2011 , was 7 % , while the number of cases of theft and blackmail in connection with weapons , munitions , explosive and explosive units , fell by 7.8 % in the course of the last few years .
In the United States Fast-Foods and Supermarket workers
Every fourth American youth is eventually sitting behind the Kasse of Mc Donald &apos;s
In the last few days , there has been massive protests in the US against low wages in shops of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald &apos;s , Burger King , Taco Bell , Wendy &apos;s and Kentucky Fried Chicken .
Nobody can predict whether the protests will be even more outrageous , or whether they will soon be coming to the air
The protests are supported by trade unions and several leftist non-profit organisations
In addition to increasing modest wages by simple walmtypes and fast-food workers , the organizers of the protests are pursuing the goal of establishing trade unions .
This industry is hardly a trade union .
46 Cents per year ?
The protests started last week after Thanksgiving , on the so-called Black Friday , where sales in the US were taking place , which attracted millions of customers , which sometimes led to handcrafts .
On this day , some Walmartstaff , from which there are 2 million , are left to work , and they are insulting and denying their work together with trade unions and left-wing , left-wing groups of the chain , whose target groups are
Walmart sells all products , from windmills to hunting and battery batteries to dust and milk .
The raw material in the Walmart bottles is between 8 and 27 % cheaper than in large supermarkets .
This is why many of the small-scale WalMola workers are only buying their own jobs .
The prices and the range of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA .
Critics , according to the experts , can often sell the goods to Walmart , because the employees are badly paid
The latter also cover difficult working conditions , such as missing forklifts or handlers .
The participants of the &quot; Black Friday &quot; protests were asking for wage increases and reported that the contribution to the company &apos;s health insurance was $ 30 a month .
A typical Walmartworker , which deserves 9.5 USD a day , could not afford this increase , they said .
Scientists from California University of Berkeley show that if the company increases the average wage to 12 dollars , Walmart would cost $ 3.2 billion .
That is about 1.1 % more than it is now donating pay .
If Walmart had completely to pay the salvage to the customer , every purchase would cost only 46 cents more in future .
For them , it would be more than 12.39 dollars compared to today ’ s total .
The general public of Walmart , who is a member of the German Federal Republic of Germany , is satisfied that it only has a test of protests
The Black Friday took place in its shop from 8 a.m. to midnight on Thursday until midnight , and during this period Walmart sold about 5 000 articles per second .
The Walmart boxes on the Black Friday ran almost 100 million transactions .
The spokesperson of the company , Dan Fogelman , who , in an interview , called Huffington Post , claimed that a total of less than five &quot; Walmartworkers workers , and the protest campaign only &quot; another PR trick &quot; organized by the protests was the only thing that the protest was about .
&quot; Free Kasse ! &quot;
The protests went on this week in New York , where their goal was not to make Walmart-Lions ( who are not in a much desired city and thus to date ) , but McDonald &apos;s and other low-cost restaurants .
McDonald &apos;s says that the company sold billions of portions , but you don &apos;t give you a disease and you are not paid for your honest work !
Jumaane Williams , member of New York City Council
At present , the minimum wage is the hour after federal and New York legislation at 7.25 dollars .
In Fast-Food-restaurants , the minimum wage is raised , but not too strong , and on average their simple staff in New York will receive USD 8.90 .
Less than she deserves no one in this expensive city .
How it is possible to spend money in New York is not incomprehensible to me .
There was a time when almost a quarter of all American young people were behind the corner after the school at McDonald &apos;s , but they lived in their parents .
Few saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay longer there .
Now , when I talk to colleagues from McDonald &apos;s , people are constantly being asked to pay their wages to them and sometimes even to feed their children .
On the other hand , in the Forum Wall Street Journal , the author of the newspaper notes that it is irresponsible to get children , if you do not know how to eat them .
The protests that took place on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. in front of the McDonald &apos;s , in the Duke Street and in Madison Avenue , demanded that the cleric and kitchens of Fast-Food-restaurants would receive a minimum wage of $ 15 a day , which is more than doubling the current minimum wage .
They continued to demand the formation of trade union unions in the fast-food sector .
The US law prohibits corporate governance from standing up to this goal and dismissing trade union members or dismissing them .
On the other hand , corporate governance does not make it easy
The establishment of trade union trade unions in the Fast-Foods sector is difficult , however , for objective reasons
The most important reason is the high personnel fluctuation .
Unsatisfied
The strong protests there were also many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan this day .
The culmination of the protests was a meeting on the part of the McDonald &apos;s party on the occasion of the McDonald &apos;s party , which was a member of the Council of the United States , and which was said to be a meeting of the President of the Council , and that the Commission was to be held in the middle of the day .
The protesters , for example , were supported by other prominent New York Democrats , including Bill De Blasio , who said that &apos; we should support the fast-food workers in order to give them a fair pay and to achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves ! &apos;
According to New York Times , this was the greatest action of her kind in the history of the US fast-food industry
However , only a few hundred people were on the ground , some of whom are not all in the fast-food sector , where tens of thousands are working in New York .
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise whole masses .
&quot; The brain can only be overstated by the &quot;
The new technology , popular with supporters of modern technologies , is usually perceived by the lens of a special glasses .
At its annual conference Google presented a working model in the summer , and it became known in November that Microsoft had also signed a patent .
In conversation with the leader of the group for interactive 3D technologies in Microsoft ’ s Microsoft Lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi , it is clear that the glasses were only a transit station for the scientists of the company .
It is able to manipulate virtual objects in the air with just hands and to create virtual free space .
- Please be sure to get to know the research your group is conducting
- We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine , but we want to expand the limits of this interaction .
Until now , mankind has remained largely at the stage of being used with pixies on flat screens , sometimes even touching .
But we want 5-10 years to predict radical changes in this interaction .
For example , the Xboxx console and the child sensors are progress , and no Xbox is sold without kinetime because everyone is interested in motion control .
- What is the future in the future ?
- Although Kinenching has brought the interaction to a physical level , many still appear on the flat screen , sometimes in 3D .
The input of information ( the system receives more data ) has been improved , the output has not yet been decisive
We try to change this , work on genuine three-dimensional presentation systems based on various technologies , including projections .
We must make the computer world more complete in our physical world and make it more visible
This requires the user to recognize not only the user but also its surroundings .
Then we could be much more easily complemented by virtual objects .
And first of all , we should become this well-founded virtual reality helmets !
- What do you think about language control
It is popular but is it not over-estimated ?
- You are certainly not the sole solution because it raises questions about privacy because you do not always want to know all the rest about its actions and intentions .
In fact , every type of interaction with computers is good , but each of them is niche .
For example , we worked on the management of objects on public places on a project where we were experimenting with short and narrow tracks , instead of experimenting with excited gestures .
The gestures were not the object of the object but rather the shape of a brake that registered the movements of bones and muscles .
It is relatively large , but it could theoretically be reduced to the size of a flush wire .
But the future is , in general , mixed tax types , such as language and language .
- How ?
- would you ask me to give you this sprinkler ?
They say it and are pointing it out
- I just say it just .
- Oh , it would be very difficult to recognise
- Does this mean that you want the user to adapt to what a machine can do at the time and what does it do ?
- not necessarily , but this is a mutual convergence .
I think that in the next few years we must , above all , work on developing new sensor types which will enable people to be more closely involved .
This can be the laser sensor , for example , because it provides a good resolution in depth , which is very important .
- What are the requirements of your work with the Xbox cinematic sensors on modern cameras ?
Does it mean a resolution , depth or anything else ?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection .
Of course , 8 Megapixels would not be bad with a speed of 1000 fps
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself but the quality of matrix and depth .
All the current technologies are not good enough for us , because the developers of the algorithms have more work .
Not only the resolution along the X- and Y- but also along the Z-axis must be taken into account .
The speed and the number of images per second are also important .
The movements of people are extremely dynamic and frankly , the 30 fps are too little for gestures .
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor in our laboratory in Redmond with a regulatory delay of between 1 to 100 milliseconds , with today &apos;s commercial sensors being closer to the second value ( 60 to 100 ) .
Not everyone understands how much interaction between man and machine influences .
I just needed a manual for my work , just without touch control and with more pictures per second .
- Can the number of cameras not be increased ?
- Kinum currently works with three &quot; cameras &quot; , one of which is an infrared transmitter and the second one is a receiver for the reflected signal
And the third camera is actually a normal RGB camera .
It does not serve to calculate object depth .
More cameras could solve the problem ...
Or the problem is more important , as more calculations are needed
It would be a flexible , kinect-like system where we could play with different camera assumptions to determine how we help to determine a position in three dimensional ways .
- If I remember , Microsoft did not present its glasses to Google , unlike Google .
Do you not think that , with the use of the advanced technology of the extended reality , glasses have the best prospects ?
- Of course , it is not easy to keep a smarter on the handphone , but I think the most beautiful is a &quot; changing &quot; reality , which we could turn out to be a cloud on the smartphone , which is a great option to use .
The Brille is a personal gadget and it is your strength ( private only you can see ) but also its weakness , because an expanded reality by glasses prevents you from working with others on virtual objects .
- We are currently faced with the fact that the manipulation of virtual holographic in the air is not only a Tony Stark from Iron Man , but also a Normalmormorist .
There is a problem , often the criticism of this idea : there is no emptiness reaction !
The hands are not really feeling anything !
What answers do your group want to give to this objection
- I often talk about the fact that the enlarged reality is the seventh breakthrough in interaction between humans and machine .
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactical perception .
An interesting method is currently using the second hand as a rather unusual projection .
She is taking the pressure out !
There are , however , also technologies that are geared towards the &quot; images in the air &quot; , which are actually being used to give the interval of some sophisticated ultrasonic rays on a certain point where the finger is , a feeling that is still so weak , that someone has to be asked about the handles .
There are also bands for the handgrip that are able to influence the nerves in the fingers , which is a potential direction .
- Have you tried to overlist the brain ?
It is to be remembered that it feels what it should feel when it comes to something ?
- This is a good idea , so we have not tried it .
Here is a more than a thing that we are going to fight for a long time , namely a person who is physically in a closed space , he is looking for instead in an open , practically infinite space ; here we are working on concepts with trawlers ( others as in fitness studios ) , mobile platforms and large balls .
So far the brain is only too overcrowded and many years of work are still in place .
This is what makes work in the virtual reality of a researcher so attractive : there are many topics we are just beginning to get started .
Private taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project &quot; Petersburger Avantgarde &quot; , which is dedicated to the city inhabitants , who are the avant-garde of art and culture .
The list of distinguished representatives of the Petersburg art scene has already gone to the top of the city , whose successes go beyond the borders of the city , and which often find recognition in Europe without being known to Russia .
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller .
The whole city knows Kirill Miller , the bunkers who are dressed in Rot , sometimes the Russian Museum , the summer garden , or the event of event .
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are exhibited , they attract large human masses .
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Slovenian socio-philosophical artists who create new myths .
Kirill Miller is a lighter figure of the Petersburg avant-garde at the end of the 1980s and early 90s .
He is also a man of the city and , by his presence on the street , he is giving his fellow citizens a smile to the face and providing them good mood .
He was a fan of a torn and became a member of the Petersburg racer player for this difficult role in his artistic surroundings , his philosophy and his image finally .
- Kirill , why are you always in red and not on the road , for example in Gelb or Turkey ?
I chose the colour red as fashion designer , which deals with the optics and image .
In this world , the compromise between artists , image consultants and society is a triumph
In society , everything is being called into question , which is a bit of graunorm , aggression and bad behaviour .
But I will talk to people about my provocation .
Every of my previous provocation was an invitation to talk .
- When did you know that you need to become Maler ?
- An exhibition at the Cultural Palace Newskij , where my work was exhibited .
I mean that I must go along this path .
Then the time of old free , but not officially recognized , crowns was closed , and new and free painters , as I was incomprehensible .
I was happy with the new generation pains , with the representatives of the &quot; Gazonewschina &quot; , which created &quot; Puschkinskaja 10 &quot; , and then it was finally closed .
I prefer to dance , to fashion , to music , in fact , to everything except literature .
- - And all this was in your Art-Clinic ... - I was interested in the centre of the city of St. Petersburg , where the best artists should gather together .
In 1995 I occupied a space in Puschkinskaja 10 , and there was a musical club for the Bohemian , the house of St. Petersburg &apos;s Boheme , until the renovation .
Many were born there : N.O.M. , Tequilajazzz , and I also remember how Schnur came to his project &quot; Ucho van Goga &quot; .
His friends were singing songs like Play-back , tight tribbots and even the composer , Igor Wdowin , was a great composer .
When the group started to play live , it was released from its &quot; Leningrad &quot; .
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of &quot; Halli-Galli &quot; .
We gave them Trachtenberg , and it started his big career , but the basic knowledge he learned with us .
The gallery &quot; D 137 &quot; or the club &quot; Griboedov &quot; have its origin in the Art Clinic .
Our staff and staff were then able to help
I am a hero of the last century , as culture .
In 2000 , there was a survey in the press about the award &quot; personalities of our city &quot; .
I won in the category &quot; artist of the year &quot; and I was the most successful .
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules ; I am a man of the truth , honesty and culture of the past century
Today it is easy to be famous , but culture and popularity are not the same : you can be famous without being a cultural contribution .
- Your work has an unmistakable style .
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and show the actuality and sharpness of the thoughts .
I will have an exhibition on the theme &quot; The Russian Museum as Clowns &quot; .
Clowns are timeless .
I was a social , but now it is painful and is afraid to be so .
In a clown , this is blaming everything and losing its tragedy .
I love the grotesy and I have a grotesque ideas .
Let us , for example , be the world by prescribing that everyone has a complete impact .
Everyone now respects the clothes and is not the person on the inside .
But perhaps one should not give a hand to a man , but should be blamed on him .
The deceit is disappearing by the sword .
- We saw you in the role of the city &apos;s torch player - a cultural city should have such a hero .
Who , if not me ?
- Can commercial art be beautiful ?
- Nowadays , commercial art must be cautious , cautious and insulting .
We see the destruction of cultures .
In the past , people were large groups : Bohemians loved the one and the simple people .
Now there are micro-communities , and it is difficult to all be seen .
I &apos;m not a one-hundredth dollar-note that everyone likes
Now you have to think about whom you like .
Every kultstar has about 100 folding .
- But the appearances of Stas Michailow come several thousand !
- He has abandoned women , where the sexual social sphere plays a role .
For cultural reasons , 300 people and not 10 thousand , therefore there is less management , money , and everything is based .
I have followers , and the most important thing is not to cheat them and destroy the achievements .
In my youth I painted such pictures , which even in a collector are in a series of works by Falk and Larionow .
I started with pictures that normally only come at the end of the career
Today there are often misunderstandings .
It means : intellectual culture and consumer culture .
There is no culture at all , that is something quite different
I am a man of last culture and grew with artists who lived in poverty and who were in poverty and who refused to be able to paint .
That is the culture I support .
- Kirill , what is Petersburg ?
- Good cultural experts .
It says : the welfare of culture .
But not everyone can deal with culture .
The true tsars were different , because the Zars may not understand much culture , but they understood that right experts are needed .
There are currently good consultants in Moscow .
In Petersburg , we have those who could be experts , but they will be left to the path , because there are senior experts who are going to be able to assess the first and to release them .
Now only one of its own tastes is counted
The same goes for the Charter , but with the difference that they are honest , they are not all to accept contemporary art and some painters need to look for other museums .
- What is Petersburg ?
- Petersburg is not the capital city ; Moscow has much more culture and a suitable breeding ground .
On our stones , art can grow very hard .
We need a cultural breeding ground , because , for example , we have more writers than readers , and that is not right .
There are many curious people who visit the exhibitions or concerts .
We are far less .
Art must be modern again , as it did at the beginning of the last century
The project is financed by the city of Saint Petersburg
Birth in World
The danger
Global warming or fusion with killerasteroid .
Karawans of spaceships with strawberries on board are looking for a replacement plan .
To save humanity , the important question is how to proceed in the field of gravity or on the replacement planted ?
I think many choices are not possible .
There are only two true planets that we could at least live hypothetically .
&quot; Negro Mars and Venus &quot; , says the scientific staff of the Astronomic Imperial Surdin .
However , while the conditions on Mars are relatively life-friendly , the Venus is a temperature of 500 degrees .
Life would only be possible in large scale or in the turquoise path of Venus , all
The question of reproductive reproduction was first addressed to researchers in terms of flora .
Some half a century before , experiments were carried out with plants .
The fourth generation of orbit erected ore was not the least of the irregular species .
The breeding of insects , more precise of tiny fruit ( Drosophila ) , was followed by orbit .
In 1979 , Wachteleier was sent to the world to explore how to make the most of the development of embryos .
It is developing a normal coke .
But then the problem begins .
&quot; The problem is that the cows must be found ; it must stand on its legs and start to move to move &quot; , explains the laboratory of the Institute for Medicine and Biobiology RAN , Vladimir Sychew .
The cows were not able to survive without a solid background .
Ten hours later , the instincts of newborn children were completely eliminated .
The cows did not react to light and light .
Four days later , they were simply dead .
&quot; One day we left cows and then put the whole thing , because it is simply impossible to work with them &quot; , Vladimir Sychew is stuck to the failed experiment with the kitchens in all .
The last breeding day with animals was in Orbit 16 years ago .
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013
However , the Bions &apos; Bion are only a same-sex species .
There was an experiment with rats who had already been fed into all .
Nothing special has been found in this regard .
&quot; This was just with Biosatellites , but once again it was a single experiment , and the research has to continue &quot; , noted Vladimir Sychew .
After the landing , the world &apos;s youth survivors were born .
The problem of reproduction in space has not been solved yet .
The task is difficult .
Animals who are dragged out of their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive stress .
Unlike animals , human beings could be in principle .
Homo sapiens is an abstract thought and can create a similar emotional background .
There is no such experiment as an ethical consideration .
But women have been flying to all for 50 years
The biggest risk occurred at Tereschkoowa .
The most valuable thing that humanity possesses is the female organism .
Our dream was to be heard and no one on earth could answer the question : is it the space flight ?
Will she be able to bring a child to the world after that flight
&apos;After all nobody answered this question &apos; , says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse .
In June 1964 , only one year after her World Heritage flight , he married the first female Kosmonautin , Valentina Tereschkoowa , a daughter .
The child of the child , Andrijan Nikolaev , was also Kosmonaut .
In 1988 , he wrote the second wife in the All , Swetlana Sawizkaja , who twice went to Orbit and even works outside the space vehicle , a son .
Nevertheless , there remains a risk .
We only have very few cod monsoon , where after long flights everything went well and healthy young people .
&quot; The more the more dangerous it is even when flights in Orbit &quot; , he concludes Kosmonaut Waleri Poljakov , hero of the Soviet Union and herds of the Russian Federation .
Yet humanity must seek new ways of biotechnology , radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravitation .
The hydro-laboratory in the preparation centre of the cot monauts is a compulsory centre during the flight preparation .
Here in a colossal state the cosmic routine is gaining in open space .
Water is the gravity .
Although adult water is a pleasant environment , it is an alien environment ; but infants feel water as a natural element .
It is as if the small Ichtyu testimonies declined to the land to move to the ocean .
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about nine months in the mother &apos;s milk and that it is easier to get used to water .
In principle , this is logical , since the first swimming is just 2 weeks away from the first swimming .
&quot; This is too little time to forget something , &quot; says Babie , Marina Aksenowa .
For a newborn child , the severity of the disease is a much more natural condition , and women are not being punished without gravity .
The condition of the cardiovascular muscles is very rapid and therefore the ability to blackmail the child is also very important .
Well , we are doing this through stearing aid .
The birth could also take place , for example , in a special chamber to blackmail the child .
&quot; But what happens then ? &quot; , is the not important question of Waleri Poljakov .
On the other hand , the child also needs artificial gravity
Without feeling to feel the need to escape , the body can not train the skeleton and muscles .
A newborn child cannot be put into a job on the orbit in orbit .
It is simply missing what is fundamental to its life .
&quot; This experiment , which we are doing together , that we are going to be a child in a remote environment will lead to us being able to bring to the world a disabled person , to the world , &quot; says the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute of Medicine and Medicine , Igor Pestow , .
So far , the birth of children in world is a mere theory
But when the earthquake is broken into a distant planet , it becomes reality when the strawberries are breaking up to their homes for their lost descendants .
NKU ’ s head : control of the black system is unavoidable by debt
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws , but it falls short of its application .
In the interview for Update álně.cz , this is the Vice President of the High Control Office ( Nejvyšší Controllní úřad , NKÝ ) , Miloslav Kala
&quot; A law is never perfect , but it must be properly applied - and this is not the case with us , &quot; says Kala the current situation .
A similar result appears to be shared by Czech and German auditors .
In his practical practical example , he is conducting the appointment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas on the so-called &apos; Black &apos; system .
Recently , the Prime Minister said that ODS would not harden entrepreneurs with inspections , so the system is now banned or allowed ?
&quot; A law must have its validity , and if there is a law , then it is not just the President of the Government , the authority of the police , whose duty to control compliance with the law is to be obstructed in its activities , &quot; says Kala .
At the meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control , you spoke about a joint Czech project , which compared the laws of both countries with regard to public contracts .
What was the issue here ?
This is a parallel test which we started about two years ago .
In short , it is about the European legislative system to determine how public contracts are to be handled , that is to say , the national legislation , and , finally , the actual application is the right one .
We are not yet in a position to deal with this issue , but we are not yet in a position to compare ourselves with it .
It confirms that it is not enough to constantly create new and more precise rules , and that we must also deal with the actual application of the law .
How can the project help you to help you , what is the result of this project ?
This joint control could help us to constantly try to achieve a perfect system of legislation and to reduce and suspend thresholds , if this is not a very positive thing .
Economics means being a thing at a reasonable price ( which not always is the lowest price ) and excluding illegal enrichment or even criminal activity .
But reducing the cost of contracts does not guarantee that we achieve this goal .
Perhaps it is even so that we are putting the system on a purely excessive &apos; paper tape &apos; , and those who are looking for the loopholes in the system are much easier to exploit the system than when the thresholds are higher .
You are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Public Prosecutor .
How does the control system work in Germany ?
Is there a similar authority such as our NKPP , or does the system work differently
As regards the authorities , the German counterparts are the German equivalent of the Federal Institute of Technology , which is similar to us and also has a college , which is only a slightly different form , but in principle both institutions are working .
The competences are also comparable to that of Germany , but Germany is a federal state , so that these audit hoses also exist in the individual states - this is the German system of ours .
The BRH must only be able to control the federal funds which are equivalent to our government funds
Public funds are administered by the district and municipalities , subject to control of the national customs authorities .
With regard to German legislation , is it easier than ours ?
I would like to say that , although it is not entirely true , it is not a good example , but it is often referred to as an example , but it certainly cannot be said that Germany is better off .
Can that be because the auditors are better off ?
This certainly does not , but as I said , I like such comparisons .
It should also be noted that the countries that are a model for us also have problems with this .
Otherwise , they would not have anything to do with our own authority , not ?
With regard to Czech legislation , which importance has the authority to change the procurement network , and to do so , have any consequences ?
The fact that this novel is in force for a short time is not yet in effect in our auditing .
Since our checks are taking place retroactively , we must expect some delay here .
We have now been able to take advantage of the new control mechanisms , which we have in preparation for future inspections , and to analyse and analyse this almost 14,000 public contracts , and to analyse the changes , as the thresholds change , as the thresholds for certain types of tendering have been modified , and the changes in the scope of the new regulatory framework ,
Do you think that the adoption of this law is a good thing , or is the system burdened
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption will be confirmed .
However , the problem may arise that the rules are &apos; stricter &apos; and can no longer be complied with .
The provisions of the Rules of Procedure are , for example , subject to the rules of the Federal Republic of Germany , which are to be considered to be the competent authorities ( for example , in the case of an operational programme of regional policy , the regional council ) , to ensure that any non-compliance with the
But is it sensible to make the law even stricter ?
I do not think that this way .
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system , and not punish those who have committed a mistake that does not affect the actual decision-making .
Such a system only puts bureaucracy under greater pressure .
Where is the distance here ?
First of all , we are not trying to find the best way
The Prime Minister recently said that ODS would not allow entrepreneurs to be covered by controls on the so-called &apos; black card &apos; - what exactly is this ?
Is the Black Sea system now banned or allowed ?
A law must have its validity and , if something is not legally banned , then it is not just the President of the Government , and the supervisory body , whose duty is to be monitored once again , is in a position to act in its
He can say : &quot; We change the law and allow the matter &quot; , but he can not say that we do as if nothing .
The procurement system has relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain transactions - and this is also right for the protection of public competition .
On the other hand , it is also tragic , if the beekeepers are excluded with the best offer , purely on paper defects .
The law will never be perfect , but it must be properly applied - and this is what I think is lacking .
On the streets there are a variety of iron floors , mostly dry .
The streets of the Czech Republic are partly snow-covered .
However , the roads are well run , sometimes there is a need for greater caution .
Bad
The streets of Karlovy Vary , which were well run this morning , were united by snow and ice boulders .
The temperatures are dry to -5 to 10 ° C , and the weather is a bit warmer .
The region is no longer snowy and the steep slopes remain a thin snow-covered .
However , the ruins of the Erzgebirge are about 30 cm .
According to the district &apos;s border guard there were narrow views .
The R6 high-speed road and the road transport routes of the first round in the region are currently fully operational .
However , the railways , for example , must be built on bridges , sometimes permitting and smooth .
All road transport routes , including the mountain roads , are also safe .
However , these roads still remain isolated or outdoors , which are often snow-covered .
Particularly in the higher levels , greater attention is therefore required
Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads east Bohemia there is danger of ice glaciers , in higher layers and in the mountains , sometimes there is still an outgoing snow-park , and the road and motorway links are shared on its own websites .
The road companies warn against cyclists , which can occur in higher elevations in the Pardubice district .
The main road is in the direction of the second and third road class , in the direction of Lanškroun , Ústí nad Orlicí , Polička , Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto .
The streets I / 43 and I / 34 at Svitavy are treated chemically .
The snow lies in the Krkonoše Mountains and in the mountains of Orlické Hory
A snow-covered snow-shoe is located in altitude on the streets of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov .
In eastern Bohemia it is mostly sunny or hot today , and it remains largely abrupt .
The temperatures are between -3 and + 1 ° C , a weak wind .
Pilsen
The streets in the Pilsen district are well run today , but more attention is required , and the driving is adapted to the weather .
This is frosty in the morning , with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freeze .
As it was beaten and temperatures dropped , it could come to ice on the streets .
It is also possible to expect a spherical , but the visibility is improving in the day .
These data are from the district councils .
The motorway D5 is practically full of traffic , but the road planners are more than half kilometres from the city .
The first road races are mostly dry , but dry .
The south of the pilsen and Tachov district , however , can be seen as an ice glacier .
The second and third road class trains are moisturised , and this is why the reference to possible steep sections is also valid .
The most frequent roads in the Bohemian Forest are especially heavy .
Olomouc
With snow-skating , drivers are expected to climb the hill in the Olomouc district .
After the use of streams , snow-vatsch continues on the pass Červenohorské sedlo and on the road towards Videlský kříž .
The road was used by the road masters , and the town of Šumperk was about 3 cm Neuschnee .
The railway is generally accessible in the rest of the district .
&quot; In Šumperk , there are still snow slopes .
On the pass Červenohorské sedlo , drivers must be counted in the direction of Jeseník with Schneematsch , and a team of the Šumperk road company today has been appointed to the
Her colleagues in Jeseník County also had to be told at night , according to their information , the roads to the elevation are free and wet .
The towns of Olomouc are able to fly freely , but the Šternberk district is also a great place to go for walks in forest areas , as there are still moises .
Ústí nad Labem , district Liberec
In North Bohemia the road masters are reporting several poorly run road sections .
In addition to several places with snow or ice glasses , the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in the district Ústí n.K. is locked according to the traffic police
The temperature is lower than in the lower reaches , and the lower and lower levels of the mountains are not so often the same .
No traffic disturbances have been reported since
The lake is reported by Štětí .
According to meteorologists , there were ideal conditions during the night - day on rain and melting snow , sunken sky and frost at night .
The road is also known as the &quot; U &quot; and &quot; Uffizi &quot; .
The blockade of the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary due to the alps pressed by the snow-down to the road .
Season Ornest : We want to build positive energy on our concerts .
What do you think that in less than a month the World will be taking place ?
That is one of the disasters that we are so happy to make .
With our band The Tap Tap we are more funny and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or to prevent the world .
In December , you also realize a unique project with three concerts against the World .
Can you give our readers more insight into the project
It is a national event that we are planning for two years .
We want to use the marketing potential of Maya Calendar , which is scheduled for 21 December at 11 : 10 a.m.
On the day before , on the 20th of December , three concerts will take place in Prague , Brno and Ostrava , on 20 December
The end of the concerts is due to be held in the time of the season , on the Pacific island Kiribati , which is 12 hours before us , the Maya calendar .
Who originates from this idea ?
I was able to get to the idea of the idea of being honored with our graphic photographer Honza Augusta
We do not want to be able to collect enough positive energy to prevent the world &apos;s death , but we also want to think about the public to the extent that we are giving our children to that world
At the end of the Maya calendar , we also have a unique collection of shoes , t-shirts , bags and key trawlers to combat the world scene , which allows us to support the purchase of www.e-tap.cz .
The band The Tap Tap also accompanied with other performers the so-called anthem against the World Inspection with the title &quot; World of World &quot; .
Today , the anthem of YouTube are very popular , and will they also be on the Benechtsconcert ?
Of course , in the end , in the end , assuming that everything is clapped and that the world undergoes ...
The hymn is to be sung by all the performers on all three concerts .
In addition , the anthem are transported live on a direct circuit from Czech television .
The lyrics of the Hymns are also written by Tomáš Hanák , who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip , also Xindl X ...
How did you come to cooperation with both ?
We also cooperate with other people in the Czech culture , which means that we are able to realize many charitable events and concerts ...
We try to involve these people in our projects .
It has shown that most of our work with us is interested and has fun .
What is the purpose of winning concerts against the world scene ?
For the establishment of the barrier-friendly training centre Studeo , on which we already work six years together with the club Tap in Jedlička Institute .
The Felices ’ School is regularly managed by lectors , which help them to enjoy various leisure activities .
Since the students do not have the resources to look for the lultors , we want to help them in this way .
The finishing of the Jedlička Institute is to create a building in which we then come to the project .
Every concert takes place on a series of groups and performers
What criteria have you chosen to do ?
We wanted to create a programme that would raise all generations , including children .
In Prague , for example , Chinaski , Support Lesbiens , Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta , The Tap Tap , Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý .
For more information , please visit www.kpks.cz.
Are similar &quot; big events &quot; planned for the future ?
In May we will be celebrating the first time in Prague Spring , and we will be presenting an interesting program with interesting guests .
Next year we would like to be in the Czech house in New York , and I personally - if we are already in the US - would like to join in with appearances in Washington and Chicago .
Your outlines are not small , so you have already had them in Madrid , Brussels , London and Moscow .
However , the Tap Tap is a group composed of people with disabilities .
How do you manage these trips logistically and
It is not as bad as it appears at first glance .
We have a wheelchair , so that wheelchair users are allowed to carry wheelchair , and we must of course also carry out many other types of equipment and other baggage ...
Nevertheless , it has always been without problems , ČSA and British Airways always prepared to be prepared to be quite sure .
Even in Moscow , where we were recently , there were no problems .
With your foreign travel you have a comparison of how it is possible to compare the situation with disabled people in the various countries .
How have you seen these things ?
After Madrid , Luxembourg , London and other cities where everything works better than with us , we were in Russia , in the past , seeing that everything in the East is still in its beginnings
Moscow is not a place to be missed , but it is still unusual when someone is on the road in the city centre .
It is not even a matter of course that a wheelchair driver is allowed to be taken to the lift
Fortunately , clubs are also being created to deal with the problems of people with disabilities .
And what is the point in terms of the advanced countries ?
There are many things we are lagging behind ...
However , it must also be noted that improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of those concerned
In London and Madrid , it is absolutely common to ensure that people with serious disabilities are also able to go home , go to the museum , take advantage of toilets
But it is not quite common that a larger group of disabled people are actively involved in social events , and we are doing a bit ahead with the band The Tap Tap !
Respect for the public and accessibility is one thing , but only when there are important athletes , artists , actors , politicians , and lawyers , things are really going to change .
So far , only individual cases of particularly arbitrary individuals are involved .
The Tap Tap is very popular at this moment , but if we are back a couple of years , what about the reasons why you founded a band in 1998 ?
I started to work as a maintainer in the Jedlička Institute , where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something very intensive .
And since I am a musicist and , besides , saofon , I have been a member of a music-group
Na , and with time , how our presenter , Láďa Angelovič , is going to be put out of control ( laughing ) .
But the band was known only in the last few years , or is I wrong ?
It is true that we have helped to cooperate with well-known singers , and we also started to actively promote us .
We have realised that if something is done and that it is not to be seen outside , its own performance does not exist in a sense .
Thanks to EU subsidies , we can also afford good quality lacquers , high quality appliances and other products
Was it your goal to get it so far with The Tap Tap ?
From the beginning , I felt the potential to tackle things differently .
Today , the show business is copying one another .
This is logical , because everything is being considered with caution and will only be accepted after a long time .
There are few really unique things , and I dare to say that Tap Tap belongs to this .
The first impression that the audience usually has is , of course , compassion , that is natural ...
But this pity is absolutely unnecessary because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we must regret .
They are people who live and can develop in a full life , provided they have the necessary resources .
I always say that if people with disabilities are able to do something , this is not just a progress for them , but for the whole society
Was it also helpful for this success to be a tight boss , how many people are listening ?
If you want to make things a good thing , you cannot compromise on many things and require some discipline .
I think that is quite normal .
Some come to us with romantic ideas , and when they say they are having to wait twice a week , prepare preparatory hase and spend a lot of time on concert trips , then the enthusiasm is getting out of touch with many of them .
So it works everywhere , in any band that wants to work and achieve something .
The Tap Tap is currently 20 members .
How many of them were from the beginning , i.e. since 1998 ?
Only one thing : Láďa Angelovič .
We are an open group , people come and go , and we cannot prevent it .
We are always welcome to help you with your wishes and desires .
Finds instead of the day before the forecast World Indies , Thursday 20,12.2012 at 21 : 00 pm .
The venue is : Incheba-Arena / Prague , Fléda / Brno and Plynojem / Ostrava ; 12 Czech bands and other musicians .
All three events are interconnected by live circuit and it sounds a common interpretation of the Hymns &quot; World Inspect &quot; of the band The Tap Tap .
The aim of the concert is to provide the resources for the provision of a multifunctional educational centre , to be created under the name STUDEO in the Jedlička Institute in Prague : 25 million CZK .
The entry costs 400 CZK , children up to 12 years free , tickets are available in advance in the case of Bohemicket
Poland and space .
Last week , Poland was the European Council of Ministers of the European Space Agency , ESA , which was the second member of this space authority , and it is thus the second member country from the former eastern bloc ( after the Czech Republic , which became ESA member of the European Union on
In 1994 , Poland started close cooperation with ESA and involved several ESA projects in the following years .
Poland ’ s path to space , however , started to happen much earlier
Polish cosmosmians were also involved before World War II , and they did not always understand the understanding of this .
I recall , for example , the speech by A. Šternfeld , on 6 December 1933 , in the Warsaw Observatory , where the author presented the idea of &quot; entrance to Kosmonautik &quot; .
The ideas of the young engineer ( born 1905 ) , however , were cold and after years , Šternfeld reminded himself that only Dr Jan Gadomski had shown his work .
In 1934 , the &quot; entrance to Kosmonautik &quot; won the Prix REP Hirsch , which Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch raised .
Dr. Jan Gadomski ( born 1899 - 1966 ) was an important proponent of astronomy and space .
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines .
Gadomski &apos;s worldwide contribution to development of space travel was partly appreciated by the fact that one of the craters was named after him on the moon &apos;s erased side .
In 1925 , a railway tanker was built in Poland , which was planned to carry a missile drive .
Unfortunately , the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unaware .
It has not even been clarified whether the rocket should be used to launch or brake the dragon .
The information is only available from the contemporary press .
In 1933 , the Polish infantry began to deal with rainy events .
The research carried out the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi .
The documents provided clearly show that research was a step forward in practical tests .
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of Germany &apos;s Wehrmacht .
In 1937 , the technical press of the company , which was created in the year 1937 , was published in the &quot; Rakieta &quot; plant , and the plant &quot; Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza &quot; of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky .
Both projects involved military use of the missile drive .
The military and the military are currently being used to help the military and the police .
The committee was established in 1937 , but after two years of work , its work was completed by the war
Further articles on space travel came after the war , following the work of the Polish space company ( Polskie Towarzystwo Astronauyczne ) in the Polish press .
The first mention of this society was published in 1954 in November of the November issue of the magazine problematic , dedicated to four major articles of space .
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of a space company
At the time , there were already the first satellite satellite projects , and it was clear that research would have a future .
In 1956 , PTA was also involved in the PTA , which was founded in 1951 , and was in fact the first member of the PTA Association of Space .
The first year of the first PTA chair , Kazimierz Zarankiewicz ( 1902 - 1959 ) , was the head of the International Federation of Space .
He was born in 1959 , and was a member of the Society
PTA has been involved in the development of the highly successful meteorological missiles ( Rakieta Meteorologiczna ) , the first Polish rocket for scientific research since 1956 .
The first type , the RM-1 , was completed in 1957 , the first started on October 10 , 1958 .
The missiles with a maximum flight of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and woke not 5 kg .
Later , an improved version , RM-1A , was built , and in 1959 Błędów-Wrath started flying flight tests with the two-stage RM-2 .
The missiles were 1,4 m long and about 11,5 kg .
Another development level should be able to provide true scientific work - the Rakete RM-34 should reach a flying height of up to 14.5 km and be used to monitor altitude .
In 1962 , however , the further development was suspended
The first racket of type RM was developed in 1962 by Meteor 1 missiles .
The missiles were designed as two-stage rails , their total length was 510 cm and the starter was 32.5 kg .
Three types of these missiles were developed ( Meteor-1A , -1B and -1C ) , which differ in size for scientific instruments .
The Meteor 1A rockets had a transport space with 0.4 litres , meteor1B over 0.34 litres and meteor1C over 0.62 litres .
The maximum escape was 37 km .
In 1965 to 1968 , the Meteor 2 missiles were developed in the aeroplanes , which started their first flight tests in October 1970
Meteor 2 had a start-weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a load of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km .
The versions were then built in Meteor-2H and Meteor 3
Poland &apos;s accession to the COSPAR ( Committee for Space Research ) in 1960 , which was followed by the creation of a national COSPAR committee , was also mentioned in 1960 .
Poland also involved in the Interkosmos-program in the space research with Soviet satellites , and in 1978 , the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski , after the Czech Republic , Vladimír Remek , was the second intercosmonaut .
The lifting of the law on non-profit work is not a solution
Last week the Constitutional Court suspended the law on non-profit work .
This decision has made a lively debate in public .
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective .
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition .
In the end , it means that the individual economies are interacting with each other in a permanent conflict
This is the principle of free trade and the free , unlimited movement of private capital , which is handful of financial speculation .
Due to the large differences in the value of work ( wages ) , prices are rising .
This concept is a situation where manufacturers try to compete with commercial competition by importing cheaper goods by using competition , thereby increasing the share of the market and increasing its profits .
Most companies , for their part , are doing so to buy their production abroad , or to buy it out there , or to spend their business , the result is high unemployment in countries with comparable labor costs .
Since private capital does not have social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it generates , it necessarily increases government spending .
This situation is being reinforced by the fact that entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and to replace the social and social damage caused by them .
This situation is generally known , so that there are no specific statistics on this matter .
The rudimentary practice of private capital is a situation in which governments are forced to compete in competition with competing countries to reduce the social level of their own people artificially and thus to attract foreign capital to the country .
In other words , governments provide private capital without regard to social consequences .
This is especially true in changes in legislation .
The aim of these measures is to force their own people to accept the dictates of private capital , especially in the area of wages .
This is due to economic constraint in long-term unemployment , and to the reduction of workers &apos; rights .
The result is growing poverty , as well as ever greater differences between rich and poor
In Germany , there have been public food production agencies for some years , which are no longer able to feed themselves by their own work .
The number of those affected is already in the millions
As a result of increasing competitiveness in Germany , it is regularly cases where workers are given such low pay that the state must increase their incomes to a minimum .
Such a scandal was also covered by the help workers in the German Parliament .
The country ’ s fiscal austerity is , without doubt , the same thing as the level of austerity that is being imposed on people , in the face of a disastrous fall in their social level , to emulate ( as it was in the nineteenth century ) , or to be seen to be a source of hunger on the margins of society , and to hope that some of the capital &apos;s capital will be on the
This is where the question arises of where this capital comes from ?
If it is to be found in other EU countries , it is only the poverty of a country in the other , or capital is quite different , because in China , India , Brazil , Turkey , Morocco , or Egypt , or in Africa , the workers are working for a fraction of European wages .
This applies to Latin America .
Liberals and media claim to be too excited to say that the government is not allowed to take capital of capital to its own economy , and that planning economy leads to economic catastrophe .
Private capital insists on its position that the government must not interfere in the economy .
Then we must ask whether private capital is not a question of whether or not private capital is influenced by the whole state , or even by its own selfish sense
Here is the clear answer : yes .
The proof is that the existence of a virtually all-powerful and all-encompassing lobby is all
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption , mutual representation , legislation , in which practically everything is not punishable but is not punishable .
In Germany , the situation is that a State Department is charged with a public government that is poorly bound by a large number of legal entities that are engaged in the development of patent patents
These draft laws will then be adopted by the Bundestag
All violence is no longer the crowds of the Western constitutions , but of powerful financial groups that prefer their own interests .
Obviously , liberal democracies are currently rapidly emerging in a situation that , in its work , is being described as a situation in which Appian &apos;s work on the crisis of the Roman Republic has been described as a cliché and plumeius : &quot; The state has been in a
For lubrication , by unlawful savings of profit or with stone and sword .
The first of these is the &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; and the people who were not a consul , and the people were not able to speak about the fact that the only medicine in this conflict was to be elected , and that , in this very difficult situation , the only medicine to be elected was to be elected , and that , in the end , Appian thought that he was a member of Pompeius , but the strong man was , after all , the cushion who was a permanent man in the hands of the people of the country .
As is evident , today ’ s society , as well as in antiques , is based on the reckless preference of its own advantage without being held to a general social interest .
Private capital is already unable to recognise and enforce the benefits of the whole society .
The result , as it was then , is an unprecedented decadence of elites , which are not doing the best to carry out deeper reforms .
The cause of fascism and Communism must therefore be the unbridled liberalisation of economic systems in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries .
From today ’ s state , the decline of these regimes can be seen as a certain pause for liberal democracies , which is already taking off .
It is particularly unfortunate that today , the elites in the future are facing a total of hundreds of thousands of human lives , the humanitarian and social disasters which we are witnessing today , and crimes against humanity , as we know them from the older and new history , in total ignorance .
The lifting of the law on non-profit work is not a solution , at least not a permanent
Under pressure from global and European economic competition , the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to put the social level of the population down .
This trend is therefore systemic .
The only solution is targeted policies of policy , social reform that increase the state ’ s share of capital , increase the public ’ s influence on the government , and weaken the monopoly on private capital in the government .
Israel : the Reality of Chaos
&quot; ... that nothing is created or ever created , &quot; singing Sting in Lied Fragile , whose most important verse is in the Refrain : &quot; ... so we don &apos;t forget how fragile we are &quot; .
&quot; If my sons were not wanting to war , there would be no , &quot; says the dying Gutele Schnaper , wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild , in 1849 , and
After the last wave of violence between Israel and Gaza , there was a number of reactions .
One is in favour of Israel , and argues that the Palestinians are being held in a position to be terrorists , and the others are supporting the Palestinians , and they argue against the racism of the Israeli state , with the genocide committed to the Palestinian Arabs and call the state of Israel to be terrorist .
I do not want to tell anyone who is in this recurring age of killing the victims and who is victims ; in the end , the inhabitants of Israel , including the self-governing regions , were in the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence itself .
I am interested in opening the eyes to the reader , looking at the 95 years of tension ( calculated from the Baldo Declaration in November 1917 ) in the small plague in the Middle East , most of all .
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts , others are derived from them and are starting from my own understanding of who or what group of people are influenced by the events of modern history .
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power .
In each epoch we can make a Alexander the Great or Napoleon .
What is less obvious is whether they really always had these personalities , who were autonomous , or whether they were behind their throne , who turned their actions into a predefined goal .
We must acknowledge that we are living in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in a few individual individuals , and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not come into existence within the life span of a generation .
Among these astronomical families , one of them is especially distinguished by the fact that one could call the head of the cows ( I do not know whether they still stand up , but I don &apos;t close this , but the
Much is not written about it .
Obviously
The first press agency ( Reuters ) was bought by the Rothshid in the 90s , to abstain from its name with highly criminal acts , in which the foundation of their power was always to consolidate their power , or both of them .
The Rothschild , which is part of the world ’ s largest banks , are in fact , and against the countries in which they are involved , they are 7 countries , and they are 7 countries , after the fall of Iraq , after the fall of the country , after the fall of Ghaddafi , after the fall of Ghaddafi , they were still in the hands of the Russian government , and the country
Anyone who has always tried to counter this family has to pay for life .
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothshids Bank of America as a central bank , beginning in the civil war , he started to give up his own ( say : state-owned ) banknotes and was murdered in a theater in 1865
J.F. Kennedy started to abandon his own banknotes and wanted to rid the FED - he was murdered in 1963 ; member Louis Mc Fadden poised in 1936 , after he was poisoning the FED for the resolution of the Great Depression in 1929 .
The global power of power of the Rothshid in 1859 , in 1871 , led to the formulation of a plan to dissuade three world wars by Albert Pik , a freeman of 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge .
The first war was to be a goal of breaking the world , and the first war was to be done to destroy the world &apos;s great monarchist nation , and the third war would be reduced to about 0.5 - 1 billion people , and would not be able to consume as many resources as possible ; to create a universal religion ( ecumenism , but to be the only one here ) , and to lead to the ultimate power .
The method that the group of wealthy families working with the Rothshids is working on is to solve a crisis and to offer the subsequent offer of a solution ( order from chao - order from chaos ) .
These solutions are , however , wrong and are always causing the situation to worsen ( see the establishment of the FED , so that crises such as those triggered in 1907 ) are not repeated .
After the murder of the Habsburgs Ferdinand in Sarajevo , the Great Wars , they destroyed the Russian empire by the Bolsheviks Revolution .
The First World War ended with the sudden , militaric , and economically unfounded capital of Germany ( for the destruction of the Russian Tsar-rich war , the war no longer needed ) , and the resolution of the Central European Great Reich was followed by
To help the Germans , they were able to be able to make a difference in the face of a lack of understanding , and they were not allowed to be able to help them to make their own decisions .
At the end of the 19th century the Rothschild initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement , which was a branch of the establishment of a Judgean state , possibly on the historical territory of Judavia with Jerusalem as capital ( return to
The Balfour declaration already created the precondition for mass emigration to Palestine , and there were first interctions with the indigenous Arab population .
Terrorist attacks have existed on both sides .
The Second World War broke out , and whether Hitler was in the hands of the chain of bankers , who had been on the map for the first time , or whether everything was to be considered to be a plan , it is true that the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps was a precondition for the recognition of the Jewish state by the World
Israel was founded in 1948 , and as the war reparations against Germany were prepared to prepare for the Second World War , the government of Israel is establishing the focal point for the Third World War .
If international bankers are to be able to escape this war , the Jewish people will be victims of the most extreme battle , this time in the Second World War , with Arab and Muslim populations in the Middle East .
Israel is like a huge laboratory , a source of conflict and chaos , not just in the country itself , but also internationally ( only to think how sharp people are divided by those who are in both supporters and opponents of Israel ) .
Who is the guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis , where wrongly dissolves in a endless spiral of violence , with the very beginning of the greed and their pursuit of global power ?
It is important to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders , but the international bankers in Israel , as with us , are only their own candidates .
The current prime minister , the Yanjahu , who is a loyal partner of the Yahu , is a member of the Alliance for Cooperation , which is a model for the fight against terrorism , which is a very serious one , and which is a typical example of Iran , India , Russia , Pakistan , which , in terms of controlling Iran , could be able to destroy the world economy by means of its only 2 miles wide road , which is only 2 miles wide , and which is a typical example of the world &apos;s most important economic and economic situation .
In what light , the words David Rockefeller from 1994 appear to be : &quot; The only thing we need is a whole round of crisis , and people will welcome the new world order &quot; .
In their conception , the new world order is a world of men and slaves
A world where the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats .
A world in which every newborn is implanted in a pan in order to undergo complete control of this substance .
&quot; And the great thing that the poor and the poor , the rich and the poor , are giving a picture of their right hand or their right hand , or to their forehead , that nobody can buy or sell , he has the painting , that is , the name of the Tiers or the number of his name .
Here is wisdom , who has the mind to consider the number of animals .
Because it is a man number , and his number is six shunders six .
The movie Argo : If &apos; s worst to call Hollywood .
In November 1979 , a Mob demonstrated the American Embassy in Tehran , and took 52 diplomats to the rank of a spouse .
They demanded to extradite Sharon ’ s muddled Mohammad Reza Pahlavi , who was fled to the US after the revolution , which had protected the patronage over his regime for decades .
There was no positive way for the American government to do so , and it could not afford to throw the shah off , as it had severely damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries .
At the same time , it was unable to impose the freelance of the hostages in Iran , where the revolution was in the hands of a theocratic regime
It was a major blow to the reputation of the united states , and the subsequent Fiasko , in the violent attempt to free ourselves , made everything worse .
After 444 days , diplomats were released after the Algerian government negotiated .
The fate of the hostages has brought a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment to home .
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980 .
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the US a small part victory .
Six botanic workers were able to fly before the ship was commissioned .
This ended after many complications in the district of the Canadian ambassador .
The CIA was able to help the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees to Iran , to cover their true identity , to travel to Canada , to be a member of a film star , who allegedly visited the country for a science fiction film .
Mixing Genres
The plan developed by the expert for &quot; Exfiltration &quot; , Tony Mendez , also required Hollyholz cooperation .
In order to be credible , articles published on this film project were published in professional magazines , there were press conferences , and the fictitious production company had a real office .
The details of this operation were kept secret , and the film was based on the memories of Tony Mendez .
Afflecs film is a special combination of several film genres
On the one hand , he is a realistic policeman , but also a so-called &quot; CtapMovie &quot; , that is to say the story of a successful Husarpiece , such as the movie Ocean &apos;s Eleven .
The album is a part of the film , and the documentary scenes from Tehran ( in the title sequences are shown in the title sequences ) . The film is also seen in the film , and there are no big differences in the film version of the same .
On the other hand the loose passages from Hollywood , which are ironically and slightly overlooked .
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table , on the official riders , on the phone ...
Ben Affleck has succeeded in rebooting his career with this film .
A respectable actor has become a respectable director , and he is no longer the goal of ironical observations .
Argo is his third film after the Crimi , not a child game ( Gone Baby Gone , 2007 ) and the Thriller City without mercy ( 2010 ) .
At the same time it is Afflecs ’ first film , which does not play in the lively Boston
The mood for the atmosphere of the village was one of the features that the previous film of this director shines down to the standard Hollywood .
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of action in Argo , where Tehran is playing .
The best scenes of the film are the reconstructions of the film , which has taken place in the entrance sequence of the message , which is very impressive in its visibility , but it gives the feeling of the confusion and the unpredictable that is coming to pass when the story is moving .
Affleck has also had a similar effect with his team , with fictional scenes ( the wrong film standing on a basar in Tehran ) .
Too many Actions to Too many
The director also had to deal with the fact that history does not really offer exciting scenes in a film mix .
However , he is doing some work on the same thing , which is a good thing , which is not always the same , which is not always the most elegant ( the scenes in which the threatening crisis at Tehran airport is being turned off from a US telephone , or the fact that the way to go on the runway is somewhat artificial ) .
Argo ’ s weakness is its too broad spread of disarray , which is bound to be too much of an act to be shown to too many places
The film is a great example of the role of the film .
The film is a film that is a bit of a bit of luck , and it is a film that is to be followed with a certain interest , which can be seen in the design and the retro style of a thriving retro style .
But enthusiasm is hard to wash .
As a reminder of a story that has to date been a living story and a proof of how outstretched the ideas of all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are , it is sufficient .
Guidelines for the bubble of air balloons , bananas and for the circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server , which annually calls a survey on the absurd bank charges , has decided this year to organise the &quot; Absurt Regulation or Idea from the EU &quot; .
&quot; This idea brought us to this idea , which was recently launched by the EU , to introduce a 40 % female unemployment rate in the management of large European companies , &quot; said Patrik Nacher , who is involved in organizing this survey , opposite to the
Among the nominations , for example , the Court of Justice judgment on the unification of insurance rates for men and women is being established .
Until then , women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance , because they objectively pose a lower risk for insurance companies .
&quot; Other incredible incidents from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year .
The vote will take place until the end of February 2013 , and later .
Among the controversial EU regulations , the Commission is also in favour of a ban on bio-ethanol , which is a ban on the reliable mercury thermometers , because it contains a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance , or also the directive on the size of chicken fibres , which , in this year , have been much more expensive .
In the past , the practice of using the term &apos; butter &apos; or the ban on traditional light bulbs was also invoked in the past .
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus is often under pressure from this or the lobby of trade and industry , whose demands in Brussels are usually represented by one or several Member States ( so the Czech Republic is currently trying to impose the requirements of Czech banks , for example , by means of a
Lobby-interests were also behind the fact that bananas must be the highest trading class in the EU at least 14 cm long and not have a &apos; jungle &apos; .
The European Commission has argued in this connection that it only wants to harmonise the non-uniform national standards which would hinder trade .
The standards on fruit and vegetables were already used by the EU to oppose the opposition of some countries to the point that the directives that have been adopted would lead to a waste of foodstuffs .
A candidate for the success of this survey may be the EU regulation last year , which , according to air balloons , has to indicate that children under eight years must not be able to raise the air balloon without supervising an adult .
The EU was relying on an American study , which is the leading cause of death in the wake of balloons .
The same limitation applies to children under 14 years of age when using the products .
Short of the day
It is also absurd that a directive on European officials , which is an official function , is not a matter for Greece , but rather for the name of Macedonia , and must instead be used by the European Commission to use FYROM ( Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ) .
The Bankovnípoplatky.com family , together with the Liberal economist Laissez Faire , also nominated the EU Regulation on the scope of food stocks in the territory of a Member State , alongside the above-mentioned absurdities .
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food stocks that could be found on the European Union &apos;s accession to the Czech Republic on the day of our accession .
Czech Republic then surpassed the set of pilgrims for pilgrims , which threatened to impose a great deal of fines .
The survey of the survey was also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money to have a sea , or , rather , to give subsidies to support grants .
These ideas were not , however , from Brussels but from Prague .
&quot; We are disadvantaged by this , we do not have a sea
We will request reimbursement from the EU , in autumn 2004 , the then Minister for Agriculture , Jaroslav Palas , declared that the EU was to be granted
He argued that cereal farmers had been very high and that the state camps were overfilled as a result of the so-called intervention purchases .
As the Czech Republic has another road to sea ports , the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us as a result
The European Commission , after all , came to the end of the Czech Republic to tender for tender on the purchase of grain from countries which have no access to the sea .
Funding grants for subsidies to the municipalities offered the municipalities the Ministry of Regional Development under the guidance of Minister Pavel Němec ( US DEU ) , and this should be a means of putting funding to Brussels .
EU : Bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations , however , are easy to achieve in the Member States , but the EU &apos;s efforts to regulate and hence to the efficiency and development of the whole European Union are more worthy of recognition by some experts
A serious problem , in terms of these experts , is the EU &apos;s funding for projects which , in the purely European way , have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration , but which were imposed on individual Member States
In this way , the fact that the Czech Republic is also being called upon to fight the right to use specific names of traditional products in Brussels , and that this struggle is not always gaining ground , is also to be seen here
The Czech Republic , after a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria , was able to defend the name &quot; Olomoucké tvarůky &quot; , the national country ( Tuzemský rum ) , whose tradition was back to the 19th century , but our producers had to rename them in &quot; Tuzemák &quot;
The term rum may only be used for products derived from sugar cane distillates , not for sugar beet products .
In the official list of the products in the EU , the world-famous cheeses of Feta and Gorgonzola , the garbage marzipans and parmakers , are now also in the centre of the town of Carlsbad , Carp , Carp , Pohořelice and Třeboň , or the Saazer hops .
With an EU brand , the Pardubicer Lebkuchen or the Hořicer roles can be buried .
&quot; People want to salvage the Republic , but I &apos;m just an amateur , &quot; says Okamura .
Mr Senator , how do you get to grips with the idea of presiding over the President ?
I am not a question of being a Senator or president .
If it were to work all without problems in our country , I would not be anywhere .
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been plundered for 20 years , how thieves are going to run around , while people are increasing taxes and retirement age .
I had no ambition to become politicians .
But if I do not like something which I do not like , I try to propose a solution to change this .
And since I am over 40 , and this is independent and partisan , I have no other way to influence things than to stand up for the president or the president .
The Senate has managed to make it the right place to go to the castle .
Do you not make your voters the backbone ?
I have told all the time that I will be taking the battle for the castle after the result of the Senate elections .
I then clarified this and said that I would stand for the President of the President , if I am elected to the Senator .
But my goal is not the function , the function is an instrument that I can implement my vision .
I need as much influence and as much power as possible to achieve this
But the difficulty is not only to squeeze us as a people in the pub and before the TV , but to make everyone who wants to change something .
The media , which want to smoke , are going to be able to smoke and to confuse freedom with freedom .
For instance , I was told that I would be a journalist or that I was a consultant of Jiří Paroubek
Talk about your visions .
The battle around the castle has taken over the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians and retrospective declarations of wealth over 20 million crowns .
You must change legislation .
As President , you do not have competence in this respect , and only the Senate as a whole can bring forward legislation
How do you intend to solve this problem
As a simple citizen , I have campaigned for the travel guide to remain a free trade , and this has been achieved .
The problem is small-minded policy - if someone comes from either right or left to a good proposal - it is deliberately rejected , and that is only the people .
As an independent party , I have a far greater potential to gain support to all the parties represented in Parliament .
My advantage is that I cannot take on board , without dragging and party dogmas , any party that is the best for our country .
Do you think of politics rather right or left ?
From a Czech point of view , I think people are looking rather left .
But I think this legal left-wing thinking is absolutely insignificant .
It is important for me to move forward .
I am not talking about whether someone belongs to the left or right ; I want to connect people .
I support all of the good solutions , even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS , and I am going to oppose bad ideas .
It is misgrading when someone calls you populists .
But do you not confirm that by what you just said ?
If you are planning a business plan in a company , you also have an ideal goal and vision .
And you want to get closer to this .
This may be termed populism , but all the proposals I have spoken about are already in the world , or they are discussed by important experts .
But without Parliament ’ s support , you will remain just
And that is not the long-term policy that you are doing
Or do you think that , if you are speaking enough enough to talk to people , you will be able to enforce material and criminal liability ?
I have no other option .
Politicians , journalists and public opinion try to convince and try to get them to the bottom of the agenda .
As a President , I do not have any difficulty in inviting the chairmen of the parliamentary parties live on television to legally enshrine material and criminal liability for politicians , officials , judges and prosecutors .
And the talks should then be told , if they are , why .
A strong person pointing to abuses can exert pressure on the political scene .
Just take the direct election of the President , who has been a service of public pressure .
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur ; I am neither a genius nor an intellectuals .
I try to find allies for my views and visions .
I just started with politics and try to find support for my programme .
I always try to assess things themselves ; and if it is not enough , I will return to the private sector in six years .
This sounds like a bit of Okamura &apos;s Czech Republic should save .
I am not a retter .
I know I have nothing to gain from it , and I have spoken to several well-known people about whether they want to stand up for the Senate .
I spoke for example with Radim Jančura , but who refused to use it because of workload .
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová , who covered the fraud in trade with soft fuel .
My candidacy started to be a great deal of dissatisfaction , but I am no longer sure .
Sixty per cent of the electorate has not gone to the elections at all , and the people who have gone have elected representatives of the establishment
We are only two independent in Senate .
People have chosen such a senate composition to be very difficult to implement .
However , I will fight for my visions , for example , the direct election of the mayors and district leaders .
Do you think that the establishment of a party party
I have not thought that because I have no time to check the past of any potential party member , and even not to do so .
I do not yet have money for the presidential campaign ; on my transparent account , only 20,000 CZK .
You are not a money ?
You talk of asset declarations , how saw you ?
My private assets count to about 60 million CZK .
In Prague , I have a plot of 25 million , a plot for about 10 million , a house of about 10 million , a piece of art worth about 10 million , and an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb , which is about a million , and then I still have a few million on the account .
The Aston Martin was also a child - James Bond , as he was in the car , always liked to be a woman , and he was fighting against evil .
You drive an Aston Martin , have a wealth of 60 million and do not have money for your campaign
You say you want to change the Republic , but your own money does not want to invest in it
This is not exactly convincing .
I have no EUR 15 million for the campaign
Should I be doing about debt ?
I have already launched 2.5 million in the campaign .
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my programme is not too much interest .
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign by own means .
The costs of the campaign are basically covered by my salary as a senator .
But I could not live from senator-content alone ; for example , I could not fund my son for a school that costs 30,000 a month .
If I only wanted to earn money , I would not stand for anything .
So stay active and have a good time to get out ?
Do you not think you will withdraw these activities ?
But that does not depend on the level of the salary .
I have been doing some back my activities .
For example , my deputy is the managing director of the travel agency
The people want to see me as Samaritan who saves the Republic
But I must also live with something .
Which month income was used to you as entrepreneur ?
About 200,000 to 400,000 , and that is still the case .
However , as President , I would be completely out of business
The complete conversation will be held in the Saturday edition of Právo .
The MVRDV architects show that the real adventures are not only in the head - the example of Spijkenisse and the recently designed Bücherberg - 2 photos .
&quot; I find the building funny , it looks futuristically , and finally there is something interesting to see &quot; , says Lisette Verhaig , a passantin on the road rand .
And Stefan Spermon , IT technician in a nearby big company , says : &quot; But it &apos;s nice , the house &quot; .
But I wonder what we still need to cover a bite today .
All have internet , iPad and e-books .
No person is still voluntarily entering one of these Old-StyleBids , or ?
Spijkenisse , a hardly visited sleeping town outside the city of Rotterdam , is a strange record holder .
The 80,000-member community has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands .
To counter this stupid situation , a few years ago , a number of years ago , the general education and the seven fictitious bridges that are on the euro seem to be rebuilt as a pretty pink steel pair .
The success of the educational offensive has remained in its limits .
And thus the city fathers saw that there was only one possibility to become the statistic : a library must be !
The design of the design of the design of the design of the new &quot; Prism &quot; , the &quot; new &quot; , &quot; The &quot; , &quot; The &quot; , &quot; The &quot; , &quot; The &quot; , &quot; The &quot; , &quot; The &quot; , &quot; The &quot; , &quot; The &quot; , &quot; The Fish &quot; , &quot; The Fish &quot; , &quot; The Fish &quot;
And while the jury looked down and rocked the axes , the freche maas stacked his exquisite folklore of size to a pyramid and ended his acally incarcerated speech with the words : &quot; Love City Communs ! &quot; .
So it is my proposal for the Bücherberg von Spijkenisse , for the so-called Boekenberg !
Nine years later , the EUR 30 million is being chopped up .
It is part of a revitalization project , which includes underground garage , supermarket , post and a few adjacent residential and terrace-houses with a total of 50 apartments .
The first edition of the &quot; Best Library of NL 2012 &quot; was awarded by the Bücherberg .
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012 .
This is the undisputed small town treparte , which had to offer to offer a postmodern pedestrian zone and a stomach town hall , behind its white facades , would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory to make a piece of contemporary architecture richer .
Especially , Spijkenisse has the first public cultural heritage in the history of his existence .
The Long Way to Book
The first impression : Büchereldorado among cheese blocs .
There is a lift that leads to the middle of the mountain massif , but the true space and reading reudes are open to the bustling climatic climate .
The roof is light and clear , and the wooded Klinkerboden and elegant street soaps are clearly the language of a public city square .
The urban environment is perfect .
You are already looking for parking , dog and football games .
And everywhere books , books , books .
&quot; Normally , the bookshelves are along the facade , and in the center there is a large , dark space , which is usually uncomfortable and inpersonal , &quot; says Winy Maas
We have put the classic room configuration on the head and the reading range is suspended from inside the outward .
The interior of the bookstore is used quickly : in the center there are offices , internet library , chess club , environmental center and home engineering center .
The black bookshelves , wall wall walls , sometimes bricks , are particularly pleasing .
The design , design and design are unusual .
Even single-colored architects and construction engineers shake the head of the unknown building .
&quot; We wanted to work with recycled materials &quot; , Joop Trouborst , project leader at the municipal town of Spijkenisse , said on request of the standard
That is why we , in a fast-farming country , one day , came to a fitting agricultural waste .
For many years , in the Netherlands , there has been a million meter-thin plastic vlies in greenhouses and in fields used as root materials .
This is cheap and timely .
The thin texture holds one , two saisons , and then it is ripe for the slave .
For the library , the fleece was pressed to four centimetres thick .
The so-called Landbouwplastic ( KLP ) is used to heat a dark , homogeneous , and capable material that is a bissl for new cars and a bissl for sports shoe .
After 105 steps , the summit has reached the summit
At the end of the almost 500 m long hiking , the Literaturcafé is not only rewarded with fantastic views of the city , but also with Dutch crockery and single-squeezed ficustrees .
They provide the atmosphere , but above all the right air humidity in the literature mountains .
Donate for the New Heath
&quot; You would not believe it , but this house is a foretaste project in the field of ecology , &quot; says Trouborst .
Healthy and cooled with natural heat .
Although the Bücherberg stands under a glass of glass , the sun is only a short time to the inside .
The wide wooden limbs , which are located around the glass facade , are used as a cover and are absorbing much of the sunlight .
The room was very clean and comfortable .
The rest is fully automatic Rollos .
Stefan Spermon , the first skeptics from the IT industry , already dared to go to the new office .
Lisette Verhaig was already there .
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde , who called the Boekenberg even as a spawning soul .
The reason : to open a few weeks ago , every inhabitant was invited to donate a book from his personal existence
This is intended to fill the optical loopholes in the still not fully crafted library - currently 70.000 pieces .
The concept has been underlined .
The shelves are filled up to the top .
&quot; Nothing is worse than a halbleless library &quot; , says architect Winy Maas .
&quot; I think , thanks to our invitation , each inhabitant has a certain relationship with this new house
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building .
And if it is only a tierce .
MVRDV thus succeeded in achieving the royal discipline that is called the practice jargon identity foundation .
Spijkenisse wrote literature about literature .
So young and uneducated , they may be .
This is , at last , a point of departure for identity
Szabo : &quot; Deutsche must play more role &quot;
Germany abstained in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine .
According to Stephen Szabo , an expert for US relations , Berlin is balancing a narrow diplomatic degree .
German wave : At the beginning of the week Germany first signalled that it would vote against the request for observer status by the Palestinians to the United Nations
Then , however , Berlin remained .
Why ?
Stephen Szabo : Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza .
Now , however , Germany must be cautious about its particular relationship with Israel
But at the same time , I believe that it does not support American positions
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel .
During the reign in Libya in March 2011 , Germany also abstained in the vote on establishing a no-fly zone .
After all , it was ratified by NATO
Does Germany have a clear position on important international issues ?
Yes , that is true .
This is because it is precisely its foreign policy that is moving away from a policy which has been managed by the United States , and which has been managed by the United States .
It is a great deal to add that Europeans do not have a coherent and coherent policy
So the Germans are being confronted between the fronts .
They are expected to play a more independent role , but they are not accustomed to doing so .
I think they are still in the same position , but they are on the road to a &apos; normal &apos; foreign policy .
A foreign policy , such as France or Great Britain
What does a &apos; normal &apos; foreign policy mean , specifically from a German perspective
It shows the readiness to take positions on national interests , which are independent of both the US and European partners .
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy , namely exports and its relations with certain regions , such as Russia , China and the Middle East .
Germany ’ s economic interests are different to a certain degree other than those of other big powers , and Germany must protect its interests
Did these economic interests have influence over the Middle East conflict and the UN vote ?
Firstly , Germany has large market markets in the Middle East , especially in the Gulf States .
It must be cautious , however , to be careful , not to mention the elixir , but also the elites .
This is certainly a matter of course .
But I would not be too much weight to attach to that , which is not a completely unilateral relationship .
But it is certainly a major role in German considerations .
Has Germany damaged its relations with the US by abstaining on important decisions , such as when it voted on Palestine ?
I believe that there is broad understanding in Europe and even in the United States .
This is why I do not believe that this is a dramatic break , as in the Libyan question .
Perhaps Germany will even be taking some respect for this .
It is clear that it is a serious matter for international players to be taken seriously and to be considered to be interested
There are various opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative .
The US , on the other hand , has clearly voted against
Are there differences between the US and many European nations ?
American domestic politics always exists .
I believe that the Obama administration has a very good understanding of the European position .
But , given the political situation , the government is not , of course , able to stand
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as big as they are always .
If you look at relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu , Obama is not so bright about Netanyahu ’ s policy .
Does it not have a hard time to agree to its close relations with Israel and the US on one hand and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other
I believe that this is so difficult for the Germans .
It would , of course , be a little simpler for the Germans if there had been a coherent and united European policy , which is not currently the case
So they cannot be part of a broader line , and instead must move things forward from their own position .
They are doing so with the euro .
In future , I believe that Germany will have a leading role to play a European position .
That is not just for Germany , for the relationship with Israel .
This has always been a sensitive subject .
But I believe that the Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role .
Does Germany itself have a role as an important international player , and Germany is going to be taking a major role
Or does Germany still have a hard job ?
Germany is not yet used to it , it is still unpleasant and , for obvious reasons , it is still difficult to play a bigger role .
For example , when we look at the euro crisis , every time Germany takes a bigger role , various anti-German sentiment are free .
This makes it not easy for the Germans .
This is actually the old problem : you are not going to be swept away by hostile countries .
Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US .
It must be a good neighbour for many neighbours and opinions , and that is not easy
Now the US &apos;s influence is constantly being taken up in European politics , but the EU is not filling this vacuum , who will stay ?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role
Even if they don &apos;t like them , they are unpleasant and make them even more unpopular - c &apos; est la vie !

&quot; trademark protection &quot; in China : If Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese .
Armani is a world-famous brand , Polo Ralph Lauren .
But what is Armani Polo ?
This is a very official name in China , which is not a matter of ownership of the origin companies .
However , she enjoys as long protection as the real name names .
And even then , it is not clear whether they are right
&quot; It is becoming more and more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China &quot; , says Thomas Pattloch , lawyer in Taylor Wessing , specializing in trademark rights in Fernost .
Every week a new case is launched on my desk .
The numbers are already a few extra letters to register their brands .
It is also possible to go to Pracci , and to Prada ’ s Prada .
German companies are also copied legally , such as the Puma sports goods manufacturer .
Pattloch opens a folder with entries of the trademark in Beijing .
On September 14 , 2010 , a Chinese company protected the trademark Zegna DF Puma , a name which was also used by the Modehaus Ermenegildo Zegna .
The fact that the Chinese are the world masters in copying and in the last intellectual property is well-known
There are many large shopping malls in the big cities , which sell almost exclusively counterfeiting .
Pattlochs , however , are different : on behalf of its clients , it is against the fact that Chinese companies are officially giving the trademark company the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere .
The Chinese call the Bang Mingpai , a front-passenger marke .
The word is directed to &quot; Bang Dakuan &quot; .
This means women , who are richer men .
The Chinese authorities are Not blaming
&quot; This is a business damage , you must fight it &quot; , &quot; Pattloch &quot; demands .
&quot; The brand will dilce , dismiss the overall setting , the image shooter is enormous .
The financial outcomes and the cost of the processing costs of the industries involved are , in particular , expensive forgery products .
According to the market research company CLSA , China is the third largest market in luxury goods and the fastest growing market with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year .
But deletion of dubious entries in the register register is hard to achieve and go to the money
Up to nine years can be the procedure , with uncertain results .
Pattloch reports cases in which the Court of Justice has been accused of having been brought to the market after the long duration of the complaint .
If the plaintiff has a bad luck , he must pay the plagiator because he is injured in China , he says Pattloch .
Sometimes there is the law of jungle .
Famous cases also include graphic elements .
In 2009 , Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany , which recently took over the German concrete pumpenbauer Putzmeister .
The Chinese , therefore , must use an emblem similar to the Mercedes sands today .
The Volvo-Wieving Geely originally used a blue white logo to recollect BMW ; the dispute was closed , Geely had to change it .
Lacoste ’ s fashion manufacturer , Lacoste , lost out of Hong Kong and Singapore , which left the famous crocodile in the other direction .
The Chinese authorities are not blamed .
The CCMO trademark in Beijing , however , admitted that there were bottlenecks in 2010 because of insufficient personnel and space .
Last year , however , we had returned to normal in the work run on normality .
This is how the unskilled claim for compensation decreased by 22 percent .
Almost 57,000 such cases have been completed , 75 % more than last year .
Still , there are still 81,500 objections in the office .
Too Much
As often in China , the figures are impressive .
Last year , the CTMO had more than 1.4 million applications on trademark protection , almost a third more than 2010 .
This is a record and , for the 10th time , China is giving the list of new entrants around the world to the authority .
The same is true for the stock of all valid trademark marks , totalling 5.5 million
2011 , 1.8 billion yuan of charges were taken
This means that every registration costs 1280 yuan or 160 euros .
The case of the German family company Freudenberg is a great deal to be seen .
For over seven years the Group has been fighting against a Chinese plumber .
The Germans could reach the end of their illegal factory of imitation cars .
But the afternoons continued to secure China ’ s rights to Freudenberg .
The company was not protected , as in Germany , Hanno Wentzler , the Chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties , was appointed to the management of the company .
The CCMO brand name also referred to the claim of Munich .
Freudenberg was right in the next two instances , but the process opponent continues to fight to this day .
We must be careful to Stay
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court .
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion and praise the professionalism of the courts .
But he also says : &quot; The procedure is extremely complex and costs us much time , money and nerves &quot; .
The internal costs were hardly quantifiable , the company archive had to have even one hundred years old files to prove evidence .
Five years ago , Freudenberg offered the opposing side a &quot; high six-digit Eurobetrag &quot; for settlement .
&quot; This is how much we can see , &quot; says Wentzler .
The risks in Fernost are even threatening to fall to Europe .
Then , when imiters are protected by unprotected brands .
A Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather .
The Group has long abandoned this business , but it could cancel the registration .
&quot; You must be polite &quot; , says Wentzler .
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful in dealings with China .
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights , but rather the foreigners &apos; all that is worth doing is to register in China , as Wentzler says .
Otherwise , it can be much more expensive than registration .
In fact , if Freudenberg is to be left behind in the last act of his markup , the opposite of the opposite is to pay for the party &apos;s own name , Wentzler .
Or we are pushed out of the market in the sector in question
Yoga Day : Stamping , sing , Help
In Heidelberg , the Chor Imbongi is projected to be active in Swasiland .
The history of a connection that exceeds more than 8733 kilometers .
First , there is the stamping : Cowboyboel , basketball shoes , ladies and bricks looking for the carpeting , find it quickly .
Two -3 .
Then the voices of the singers slowly swallow to - Alt , Bass , Tenor and Sopran- are laughing , cheating and pursuing
And Fiete Hunter , the 29-year conductor , is almost out of his gloves , when he brings together her pretty wild songs .
It is Monday night , in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg , the choir Imbongi is proving a new song
The fifty singers came from the fifty and a half years old , from the human being to the house .
Om &apos;Obani is not a simple piece , each of the lyrics , which is also in a very foreign language : Zulu , which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa , Botswana , Lesotho , Malawi , Mozambique and parts of Swasiland .
Aid to Self-help
There are around 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide , which is estimated by the United Nations programme for the control of AIDS .
235 million people live in South Africa .
In Swasiland , 24,000 Aidswaanks
More than 40 % of the population are now HIV-positive
For 180 Aidswaisen in the village Esitjeni , the Association Voices for Africa Paten found in Germany
70 They are visiting a secondary school .
You can buy a patent for 15 or 20 euros per month .
It guarantees the child school money , school uniform and a warm meal daily in Gogo Center .
Imbongi means the addition of birthdays , or even the praises .
The Bantusprache can speak fluently in this space , but singing .
For almost ten years , the choir has performed in this foreign language and it is back and returned to the place where they originally came from : in the South Africa .
The city of Esitjeni , which is located in the northwest of Heidelberg , is located in the northwest of the province of Sevenvesia , which is dominated by the German Chores
Sixty per cent
Some 2000 people live there , some still in simple lungs and stumbling houses , a large part of them are children .
More than 300 of them have no parents because they are the HI-virus .
In Esitjeni , in the small , the most abrupt of Swasiland is : the highest HIV infection rate , lowest life expectancy worldwide , known as Unicef .
The male propensity to reduce the risk of infection by half is hardly acceptable to the population .
More than forty per cent of the people in Swasiland are wearing the immune virus in themselves , with half to three years .
In the spring of 2005 , a joint African trip , the Chor village , saw the Imbongis , but many children on the streets , which not only lacked care , but simply were there : food , clothing , education .
Without schooling , there is no chance of a poor country in a poor country
At first it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school a year and to make a warm meal on the day .
But even one year later the choir founded the &quot; Voices for Africa &quot; association , which has since been almost professionally responsible for the Aids-orphans in Esitjeni .
Genealogical Infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases ?
The bacterial STI include syphilis , chlamyules and trippers ( gamma rhea ) .
Frequent viral STI are HIV , Humane Pappilomaviren , Herpes genital or Hepatitis .
Filzläuse and herbs are part of the parasite STI .
Who are the main stakeholders ?
Syphilis and trippers are mainly men who have sex with men .
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four of the five samhilis-reported cases reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contact between men .
With heterosexual adults , chlamyide infection , tetomonades , candidose ( fundife ) , trippers and Humane pappilomavicks often lead to communicable diseases .
The spread of HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults , yet approximately 20 % of HIV-reinfections are absent from this group .
Chlamyids infection is much more common among young people than other populations .
According to European surveys , three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years
Humane pappilomavives are often present in young people .
How has the number of infections developed ?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are fraudulent .
The number of syphilis infections has more than doubled in the year 2001 to 3698 illnesses in the year 2001 , according to the Robert Koch Institute of 1697 diseases
The number of HIV-reinfections has been back since 2007
There were approximately 2700 cases in 2005 .
This is about a tenth less than a year earlier .
What symptoms are they eating in a sex ?
Infectious diseases can cause spices in genital spices , injuries in urine , outflow , underwear pain , and bleak or warheads .
They often cause no pain or other symptoms and are therefore unnoticed .
How can we protect ourselves ?
Condoms may reduce the risk of infection , but do not offer 100 % protection .
For some , redirected to sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on to diabetes infections and close body contact .
This is why experts , especially in cases of frequently changing sex partners , recommend regular investigations
Early diagnostically diagnostically , most STI can be healed and avoided .
The choir , donations and the gags that the choir is singing all over Germany are a thing of the past .
&quot; We already have already sent approximately 200 000 euros to Esitjeni &quot; , says Annette Lennartz , the president of the association .
Zodwa Dlamini , a self-confident and enforcing woman , is managing the money from Germany .
She also takes care of the orphans being well off , with one of the grandmothers .
The Gogos , as the old women call them , are the bases of the village .
Some of them have up to 14 orphans , give them a roof over their head and ensure that children are on their own in their own forms on time , on time .
Those who no longer have any more , come to Khanyisile , a single woman , who is paid just as much from the club as the two men , who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children .
In addition , &quot; Voices for Africa &quot; has created a sewing school , two chicken houses and together with the American Health Organization PSI , it organizes a host of HAA tests .
That is not self-evident , because it is so obvious that the disease is all the same in the country , and it is most loved
A King with 14 Eyews
&quot; Aids is a complete taboo &quot; , says Annette Lennartz , &quot; because it has sexuality &quot; .
The king is a very strange country in a country where the king is officially married .
The last absolute Monarch of Blackafricas , King Msvati III , is known for its extravagant life .
Polygamy instead of democracy .
Among other things , this state-sanctioned life form is also being used to spread the HI-virus so quickly in recent decades .
But also the many migrant workers who are carrying out the virus through the virus .
There are many shops , restaurants , bars , restaurants , etc .
Culture is another - flesh to flesh .
To promote the cultural exchange , the Imbassy Chor , which is a joint venture of the South Africa , is singing songs , songs , truths , truths , and black and black , which many are familiar with on the southern flank of the Black Continent , and are still familiar with the times of apartheid .
A bus full of white , songs in a black language , so much recognition not only gives rise to mood and pleasure , but also has swept some grimous border soldiers to a few tears .
The journey always takes place in Esitjeni , where the singers visit their patron saints .
Even if you hardly find the small village on maps , it is more than known in the valley of the Ezulweni river
&quot; Look to Esitjeni , there is the light &quot; say the people there .
And if you turn to Heidelberg &apos;s 8733 km of air traffic , to the bulldozers in the Proberaum on the Bergheimer road , you will see it there .
Messenger : NASA discovered ice on the charity
The sonde messenger found evidence that there is a magic on the planet Merkur .
The ice cap may be up to 20 meters thick .
NASA &apos;s NASA was a powerful and reliable device for the life of the planet .
Although it is the next to the sun , there is also a frozen water , as published in the magazine &apos; Science &apos; published on Thursday , on Thursday .
The sonde messenger found evidence that there is an icecraft in the world &apos;s most permanent in the shadows .
This should be at least 30 centimetres and possibly up to 20 meters thick .
The water probably came from comets , or perhaps asteroids , which are on the characteristic .
Nobody would be involved in the discovery of ice , but with the existence of life on the planet , the chief scientist of Messenger-Sonde , Sean Solomon
The temperature on the characteristic can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius .
But the flatter could help to clarify how water and other parts of life have come into other parts of the solar system .
Unnoticed by the inhabitants , Sonden , Telescope and small robots such as Phoenix are exploring the depths of the world .
From time to time they send pictures to the earth : small guilt holes in endless weeds .

Depending on the colour , the images of spiral galaxies are to be true artworks
The recorded record of the European South-East Highway shows the several thousand light years distant trifid-nebulae in the star picture .
The name Trifid derives from Latin word trifidus ( three divided , three columns ) , as dark dust stripes triplet the glorious heart of the star birthplace .

This star cloud , connected to the rosetel foam , is also constantly producing new babies - 5 000 light years from the earth .
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust but only gas .
Scientists suggest that it was only shortly after the first wave , when the universe was mostly hydrogen .
Our insights into all : the main telescope
The telescope was to be invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - before Galileo Galilei spent one year later on the watch watch .
Since then the mirrors of the optical telescope have been increasingly growing - and the insights they deliver are becoming deeper
For centuries , from 1947 to 1975 , the halo telescope in Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the world ’ s largest radio .
The mirror , here in the picture , had an average of five metres .
In Arizona , USA , the large Binocular Telescope is .
It lets you make the eyes all the same , with two mirrors , each with a diameter of 8.4 meters
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror is on 10.4 meters in diameter .
The image of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs
However , it reaches a diameter of about 11 metres .
The low advantage of the construction : the telescope is fixed in its height - and thus restricted to its mobility .
The Hobby Eberly Telescope in Texas is also fixed in the elevator .
Its distinctive features : the high light force .
This is sufficient , despite comparatively low mirror diameter , to the world &apos;s largest mirror telescope .
With the help of a radio-artist in Arecibo ( Puerto Rico ) , researchers are listening to the whole of non-irregular signals
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 metres .
The search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence ( SETI ) can help each computer owner to make available computing power .
View to the observatory of the European Observatory ( ESO ) in the Chilean Andes .
This is the very big Telescope - which makes its name all the more remarkable
With its total four mirrors , the distance tube can also light the medium infrared spectrum .
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned on the Chilean ESO Observatory .
Its main mirror is to be 42 meters and is set together by almost 1000 mirror elements .
With pictures , it is expected to be expected at 2018
Until 2007 , the two Keck telescope on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were the largest in the world .
They are two mirrors with an average of ten metres .
The Keck telescope are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory , which is also seen in the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF .
The Mauna Kea is also meant to create a new , huge telescope - with a mirror averaging 30 meters .
It is an illustration of this .
The most important impressions from the All , however , provide the Space telescope
Since 24 April 1990 , there are already pictures of distant worlds .
Since March 2009 , the Space Telescope has been looking for extrasolar planets - especially for those who are habitual .
On 2 February 2011 , the Nasa announced that 1235 planetary candidates were identified since mission start .
The last step on the Space Telescope is documented by the picture .
The James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) is scheduled to be launched in 2018 on board an Ariane5-rocket .
The primary temperature of the Space Cell telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres .
One of the tasks of telescope : to look for light from the first stars and galaxies after the first round .
Scientists assume that there is also a strong ice cream on the South Pole
However , there is no reliable data , because the message is much closer to the North Pole around the planet .
Radar measurements have indicated for decades that there is a magic wand .
The exhibition of Messenger-Sonde , which was created in 2004 , is the first to create the characteristic - the scientists now have certainty .
Daily butter - and 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan , many people are reaching a biblical age
There is even a museum for longevity .
A quest in the country where the 97-year-old are still young .
In the south of Azerbaijan , many people are reaching a biblical age
There is even a museum for longevity .
A quest in the country where the 97-year-old are still young .
The trip through the Taly-mountains is a wild way to go .
The bus is rugged over the curve road , passing through narrow wooded hills , rolling rivers and simple farmhouses .
Everything is green and fun , you might think you are in the Black Forest .
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan , and the border with Iran is a few kilometres away .
Here the Kauca People &apos;s Federation is living , not much known , except that they are perfect Persian and Aseric , and are very long-lasting .
The terminal is Lerik .
The small town is proffered with well-equipped architecture from Soviydays , which are not so much to be missed in the picturesque mountain landscape .
From Europe , tourists come to the capital Baku , to be too fond of them .
For the 323 kilometers you need eight hours , because the road is only a short walk .
The country &apos;s richest wealth , which owes its oil to the Caspian Sea , has not yet arrived in the province .
But Pilata Fatulayeva ( 48 ) is convinced that Lerik has a heritage to the tourist attraction .
&quot; Baku was celebrated in May with the Eurovision-Song-Festival - and next year we have here a festival of the oldest people in the world &quot; , says Fatulayeva
It is the director of the Museum for longevity , probably the only one in the world .
The Vita is documented by about eight dozen tunnels from the area , which are older than 100 , Fatulayeva shows a black and white photo .
This is my grandfather , he was 120 years old .
A child is still a child in 136 years .
But the most controversial star of the museum is the sheep hirte Şirali Müsoulv , who has become 168 years old .
But there is no birth certificate .
And , with the oldest documented person , who has been thirteen years old , Müsbels ’ age seems to be extremely doubtful
In 1805 he was born in the region , he died in 1973 , explains Fatulayeva .
The man was married three times and had 23 children , and he was to be married to a daughter for 136 years .
Did Şirali Müsoulv , therefore , be wasting a few decades to his age ?
But also Rembrandt Scholz , age scientist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock , has heard of the high-fattened in Central Asia .
&quot; It &apos;s also very rare people are there in some areas of China , in Japan or Hunza Valley in Pakistan , &quot; says Scholz , &quot; also in Sardinia living extremely many very old men &quot; .
However , as a result of missing documents , there is no scientific evidence of age , especially as people are missing
Every day melted butter
But the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik often reach a biolder age .
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old .
So why do there so many people living here in the South
The Aerial Guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the tumour .
The local agent of Fatulayeva , on the other hand , believes that it is on the diet
But the calming diet of the tumour is to be so healthy , to eat meat , bread and especially milk products , and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter every day , do not appear to be plausible from nutritional point of view .
In Cengemiran , a tiny village near the city of Lerik , Rubaba Mirzayeva is the original way to live .
She is a young boy for her 97 years .
Mirzayeva , who claims to have 143 descendants , lives in a simple wooden house typical of the whole Caucasus region .
She is sitting on the floor with a butter fat , which she is tiressing and scouring .
Eighteen people live here under one roof , one of Mirzayevas ’ s sons and one daughter , both of them long grandparents .
Two young children are also around .
The kitchen is prepared with tea , which is served in typical armada glass .
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfectly in Reih and in lilied , under her headscarf she is hiding long , dark blonde creatures that are proud to her son .
I always washed my hair with milk , so they never went out and kept their colour .
&quot; Shampoo I never used &quot; , says Mirzayeva .
Monthly Rents to Life
She always forgot what she had to eat from her own farm , tomatoes , potatoes , herbicides .
I did not buy food once a day in the supermarket .
Then she tells her of her husband who was in the army .
The worst it was after World War II .
But everything was better than the &quot; beloved father &quot; Heydar Aliyew took over .
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman .
But the cult , which is being driven to the father ’ s father , who reigned his country like a dictator , knows hardly any borders in Azerbaijan .
He was the son of Ilham in 2003 , and his son Ilham took over .
After all , there is no need for Azerbaijan .
The price of the property is € 5 per day .
And perhaps Mirzayevas , who has long been a great son , is right : &quot; The Old people enjoy our culture &quot; .
They live in the middle of the family , are loved , are remedied and are happy
If that is not the reason to live as long as possible .
The Word of Man &apos; Human Rights
The revolution has returned to Cairo .
Rivalizing demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country .
The future Constitution with Sharia as a base is a serious matter .
Egypt ’ s president did not spark Pathos .
We must create the transition .
&quot; And he is a success , is my responsibility , before the people , and before God , he said in the state of Israel
His speech was directed to the whole of the people , and most importantly to the Christian Copters , the liberals , enlightened Muslims and secularists
They all , so far , have been unhopelessly stricken in a conflated opposition , fear
Fear of a god state at the Nil of grace of powerful Muslim Brotherhood .
He has , as he said , almost innocent Mr Morsi , temporarily cut the powers of the constitutional court and extended his powers to rescue the revolution .
But what the 61-year engineer who wants to rescue a PhD from the American University of South California really wants to rescue , is the Egyptians , the world is not quite clear .
Should the Judicial be deported ?
Indeed , the 234 articles that were in some worrying form by the Islamist , center-right , 100-member constitutional assembly in a nightly , 15-hour pardon of parody .
As in previous constitutions , the draft also states that there are grounds for justice on the &quot; principles of Islamic law &quot;
But what is the principle ?
That has been and is a misinterpretation and it is to be feared that Islamists will use the abhorrent wording and the legal scope that it entails to make Sharia more rigorous .
This is why at least a new article is to be drawn up : in all Sharia affairs , the Al-Aam University should be brought to the attention of the Islamic system , the most important Islamic institution in the country , with a great deal of
This is not necessary , but it may mean that the spirit is supervised by the law , which would lead to the dismissal of the Judicial Council .
Much of the draft constitutional draft
The issue of civil military justice is also problematic .
These courts , while Mubarak ’ s rule , used to oppress opposition parties
After the dictator &apos;s fall , up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody .
The state should also be &quot; protecting &quot; the true essence of the Egyptian family and promoting its morals and values .
This is a legal act in legal terms , which makes it possible for state institutions to control the content of film and literature .
In plain text , this means nothing more than censorship
In fact , no article explicitly states equality between men and women .
This is why another one of them , Mohamed and his messenger , forbids and wiped out the Prophet .
But what is an insult and how to be prosecuted remains unclear .
The wording of the phrase &apos; insult people &apos; is also a sign of freedom .
Does the President of the Council already have a caricature or a joke at the expense of legal scholars
The issue , as many of the points in the draft , which Mursi has to sign and , after his words , &apos; very soon &apos; will be presented to the Egyptians
The Revolution has Return
The opposition has been shaping the Islamists for weeks .
Tahrir ’ s plebeia was made in Cairo on Friday night on Friday night , and pledged to bring the Charter into force before it entered into force .
The revolution has returned and we will win , &quot; said Hamdin Sabbahi , third of the presidential elections .
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and ex-Chief of Staff of the International Atomic Energy Agency , Mohamed El-Baradei , declared the draft draft constitution &apos; to the bin of history &apos; .
By means of short-news service Twitter , he accused Morsi of being a &quot; coup against democracy &quot; .
&quot; When he calls the referendum , we will go to his palace and fall to him , &quot; said the opposition Jasser Said .
&quot; We are not tired , the blood of our brethren is not being heeded &quot; , the Egyptian media quoted the opposition political leader Chaled Ali .
And several judges declared that the referendum would not be monitored , which would be invalidated .
&apos;The Koran is Our Constitution &apos;
The well-organised Muslim Brotherhood , for its part , blies , but not on the Tahrir Square , but after a mass prayer on the other Nilufer before the Kairoan university .
Many concealed women and supporters of Salafists took part and called for the &apos; People to apply the law of God &apos; .
They called for Mursi : &quot; cleanse the land ! &quot; and said : &quot; The Koran is our Constitution &quot; .
A struggle for the great tahrir Square , on which everything began , would have brought about civil war .
That is obviously not what Mursi &apos;s supporters would have been
The Muslim Brotherists , both opponents of the constitutional poll and supporters , have said loud and clear .
Now is the time to let the people decide on the ballot box in which direction the country should go .
A majority of the Islamists ’ draft is deemed safe .
&apos;The word human rights does not even come before
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this vigorous constitutional process , which should actually have been in place until February and should involve all social forces .
The 48-year Human Rights lawyer and President of the Egyptian Association for Human Rights ( EOHR ) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were held in prison under Mubarak , or tried to trial .
It is not because they share their vision , but because they are indivisible for human rights .
He was convicted , sentenced to death .
&quot; And now the word human rights does not even exist in the new Constitution &quot; , he claims to be in conversation with the &quot; world on Sunday &quot;
Morsi ’ s power to power all three powers in the state has resettled the lawyer .
These measures are blatant breaches of democratic rules of play and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship
&quot; Rather than strengthening civil society , the President is effectively abusing it , &quot; he claims Saeda .
But without civil society organisations , democracy cannot work .
Saeda feels alone , also from the international community , which regards the ideological struggle of nil with a mixture of curiosity and tension .
That could be a case .
A demonstrator on the Tahrir warns : &quot; You feed a monster that can no longer control her . &quot;
Rakfisk from Norway : is this the most inhospitable fish in the world ?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards - and not just in Europe but throughout the world .
Can the country ’ s success story be something with the local appetite on fairly depleted fish ?
You will find a selection of outgoing cheeses
They are placed in a slope of dirty , movable sports clothing .
And they are holding them there a week .
So , roughly one must imagine the nasenak-wrapping smell of Rakfisk , one of Norway &apos;s great delicacies .
I &apos;m in the small city of Fagernes , about three hours from Oslo .
There are snow , spectacular landscapes - and this stubborn smell in the air that simply does not want to disappear .
The island of Salz is a great spot for those who love to spend their vacation in water .
If in Norway the darkness comes over the country and the weather is cold , Norwegians are going to a festival here in Fagernes , which is now dedicated to very tasty specialties .
&quot; You &apos;re going to eat it and spice it with a glass of Aquavit &quot; , says Havard Halvarsen , who actually works in the local fireworks , but as a so-called &quot; Rakfisk-General &quot; also the festival is organised .
To us , people eat small fish peppers and take large amounts of alcohol to themselves .
&quot; Manual people like Aquavit more than the Rakfisk , &quot; says Havard .
The spirits can be exchanged .
I cook some pairs .
If you avoid to bring Rakfisk to Nasriv , it is not bad , such as Sushi , who has a rather long bus ride .
Rakfisk is the product of a very different , much poorer Norwegian era , when there were no refrigeration and there were no longer a few days in the autumn in air-dense saltwater barrels
After a long time , he was taken out of the deep heel and - without any alcohol - consumed .
Even before a generation , thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work , and migrated mainly to the US .
Today , the population is growing rapidly - more than 13 % are immigrants , attracted by a thriving labour market , high wages and a comprehensive health care .
Even from Sweden , the old rival , which was far richer than Norway , it is not a long time ago .
Rakfisk is considered to be an important thing - an essential , albeit highly accurate , part of Norwegian history .
It is one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here .
But here is all expensive - a small glass of beer or sandwich costs a stolten 10 euros .
Norway does not often make it into the world press , and most people do not feel it to be disturbing
Here , we still find ourselves in a position to call Mr Breivik to name the racist extreme right , who was born in 77 men , women and children last year .
Instead , only the &apos; incident of 22 July &apos; .
Norwegians are hard to accept that someone in their peacefully loving country is able to be a savoury mortal .
The first responsibility for today ’ s wealth in Norway has been the growth of one of the world &apos;s largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970 ’ s
But oil is not the only reason why we are so good , says Anna , our cellar , to spread round tablets with tight Rakfisk and to emulate the hair and the blue blue eyes with their long blue hair .
We are - as we say - a prudent people .
The English is like most people here .
We are not very excited , we may not be a joke .
Norway has been treated very carefully with its oil wealth - a large part of the industry income is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations .
When , in the years to come , the global economic crisis was all waiting to be warned , Norway had closed its exchange of money .
&quot; As long as we can go skiing in winter and can go walking in summer , we are happy &quot; , Anna
&quot; And of course Rakfisk eat &quot; , adds to it with unworthy laughs
I stand in the snow and I am standing for another court - from Rakfisk I have enough .
A gay bear is in any case another , and the juice is padded .
But in the evening the delicacy is on the menu .
The hotel in which I logiere is one of several events , which organize a missile dinner , where guests can be able to vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish .
There is a live TV circuit to a showmaster , tracked by a flipper , surrounded by a rocket .
The spectacle resembles the Eurovision Song Contest .
&quot; Which point you have at the top of the mountains for the best fish , Thor Jürgen ? &quot;
&quot; Here are our points , Havard .
They are laughing and laughing
A man falls from his chair , possibly overhanging Aquavit .
But perhaps it is the strict rush of the whole fisherman .
Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto is facing a difficult start
While Mexico ’ s future president is preparing for President Enrique Pena Nieto , he analyzes the challenges posed by the BBC and the mixed feelings of his people .
The city is very badly connected to Mexico City .
Even in better days this is a stop-over town , but on Monday a ring of steel was built which shattered several important road routes to the capital and creates chaos on the streets .
However , the objective was not to disturb pendulum on the road to work , but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament .
On Saturday , Mexico ’ s new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential binder and take over the leadership of the nation
It is faced with a complex task .
Mexico ’ s outgoing government has succeeded in making Mexico economically good , but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has cost 650,000 lives over the past six years .
&quot; My government strongly supports the reduction of violence &quot; , Pena Nieto declared in Oval Office to the US President Barack Obama this week .
I will propose a new security strategy to achieve this goal .
Before joining the US President , Pena Nieto was the governor of his home country Mexico .
In this densely populated , vast part of the country surrounding the capital , opinions are shared over the new Head of State .
A direct man
The remote small town of Valle del Bravo , for example , is worth mentioning .
The tourist of the tourist is giving him the development of tourism and infrastructure .
To reach the city , you can go on one of the motorways that Pena Nieto has built and which are a great improvement over the fragile , fertile streets that once existed .
Plaketten with its name are also hanging outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change .
&quot; We expect real and sustained changes &quot; , so his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez , who is a congress member for the Pena Nietos party , the PRI .
Particularly where security and economy are concerned , we hope to see an interesting and genuine change that is so badly needed by our country .
After 81 years of power , the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000 .
The Congressman Olvera gives the party that , after 12 years of the presidential palace of Los Pinos , the party has great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto .
The opposition , the new president , lacks a substance , refusing to do so .
He is a very direct man , very committed and has great plans for the country .
He is an excellent statesman , but above all he is someone who can listen .
But , on the other side of the country , not many people share this view of their former governor .
In Nezahualcoyotl , also known as Ciudad Neza , the contrast could not be greater on the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo .
The town is hidden under motorway passes and is a suburb of Mexico City itself .
And the problems in the municipality are of a crucial urban nature .
At the beginning of this year the military was being turned into the military to combat the gangs of drug gangs operating in the quadrities , and violence against women is a particularly acute problem
The evil women of the country were left behind on a large landmine near a large landmine near a large landmine .
During the presidential term of governor Pena Nieto , he was murdered in Mexico over 1,000 women - a statistic that himself surpassed the city of Ciudad Juarez , who is infamed for their violence and the murders of innocent women .
The critics of Pena Nietos think that he has at least not properly addressed the problem of women ’ s moral rights during his term of office
But , in the worst case , his government has closed its eyes to the problem
In a concrete building , typical for the lower quarter , Irinea Buendia fights with the tears when she shows photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna .
The official version of the events , according to the events , was genocide
But their family believes they were murdered by their lives .
&quot; When I went home at home , it seemed to me that her body was washed , &quot; he remembers Senora Buendia .
There were signs that they were beaten and the brake starch had already been used .
The story of Mariana , a picture of Mariana , is a picture of a cross , and it is a cross that has one word : justice .
But this is exactly what the family has been denied to it .
The authorities have treated me as being a spouse , a bullfriend , a nörglerin .
They want to simply accept their judgement and keep their mouth .
&quot; But this is not possible when there were so many formmistakes and failures , &quot; she says .
When President Pena Nieto receives the presidential medal on Saturday , he is also taking a major responsibility .
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crimes over the past six years , and the new President has promised to deal with this problem in his presidential term .
&quot; I hope he is as president as he was a governor &quot; , says the PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo .
But the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are very concerned about this .
The prosecutor claims : Bradley Manning has not complained about abuse .
Bradley Manning &apos;s prosecution is unmistakable to his husband , and he was not able to be mistaken
The hearing is dedicated to manning time in Quantico , Virginia , in the military prison .
Defence is seeking to disclose the charge of a harassment of the place of detention
The US army is accused of wasting thousands of confidential documents .
The prosecution of the prosecution of the police on Friday , on Friday , was a test of the army of Armeeer-Ballaid-Freite Bradley Manning , accused of the greatest disclosure of confidential information from US history , to be able to complain about the abuses that he
In the case of a Catholic , Maryland , a Catholic hearing , he declared that documents on weekly visits , imprisoned during a weekly visit to Quantico , Virginia , were not received by the prison .
A day before the crusade , which was held in prison after a request to be refused the charge - men were already punished by the hard prison - Manning said he had been considered to be the Suicide .
The US Army &apos;s secret service analyst , arrested in June 2010 , is accused of stolen thousands of confidential documents during his time in Iraq .
The material was then released by WikiLeaks on the internet
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning as a source of information .
In the hearing of Friday , Fein met with manning , who had filled the officials after her meeting with Manning in the Quantico military prisons , where he had been eating in the elevated prison conditions from July until April 2011 .
The officials asked for their questions and wrote their answers .
When he asked for the forms on Friday , Manning asked him to treat the treatment by his guards as &quot; excellent &quot; and the treatment by the establishment as a &quot; very professional &quot; .
The forms , so fur , did not contain any complaints about abuse , even though the officials were directly consulted on their treatment .
He was a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , and was a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy .
&quot; You wrote ( after questioning of concerns ) &quot; No problems &quot; , and that meant not necessarily that I did not say anything , &quot; said Manning .
The judge , Colst Denise Lind , asked Manning why he did not care about his treatment when he met a committee in January 2011 to study the Suicide , which he had previously been studying on a form .
When he was in contact , he was in charge of his intention to assess the status of the &quot; prevention of injury &quot; .
The military said that it has allocated this restrictive status - which is a level under the suicide threat - to its and the protection of others .
&quot; I wanted to convince employees that I was good and that the observance status for preventing injury ( ... ) to be able to achieve a higher quality of life , said Manning .
On Thursday , his arrest and postponement to Kuwait , where he held almost two months before he was imprisoned in July 2010 , was held in the prison of the navy of Virginia .
He said he was looking to the suicide in Kuwait and was once again aware of the heat .
Not to know what has been a burden on him or in the outside world , it has been a burden
&quot; My world shrank on Camp Arafjon , on this cage , &quot; said Manning on Thursday .
I thought I would die in this cage .
When he moved to Quantico , he spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society .
They only allowed a mattress , a blank , flip-flops , clothing and glasses .
He said , he tried to stay in motion , because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or to be just added .
He has to sleep with light , which is coming from outside his cell .
If he turned around at night and saw his face no longer visible , he raised it to turn back .
In January 2011 , Mannings ’ lawyer formally contacted the treatment of men .
In April 2011 , Manning was transferred to the military prisons of Fort Leavenworth , Kansas .
On Friday , the judge in Manning asked , in his statement on Thursday , to apologize to him , that he had to sleep one night in his cell in Quantico and that when a morning is a morning he must stand guard before guards and other prisoners .
He had told him that he had never had the opportunity to enumerate with his ceiling during this count .
He was a friend of the young , who was a friend of the Prophet , and he was a friend of the Lord , who was a man of the Father , who was a man of the Father , who was a man of the Father , who was
On Thursday , Manning told him to sleep naked at the night , he tried to show an official that he had no danger to himself .
According to Professor , he had to use his plose or his flop flops to be able to violate himself , but not to do so .
In this night , he said , his uncles , flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell .
His lawyers hope that the judge &apos;s death will at least be taken into account and that his prison is reduced to a minimum , and he should be sentenced to the military court in his trial , which is scheduled for the beginning of next year
The defence has indicated that men will be guilty of a lesser death , while other charges are being challenged , which are too extreme .
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend , and the prosecution service is expected to justify the detention of the public
The Pentagon is in his position that man has been arrested in accordance with the provisions that apply to all the highest security precautions in Quantico .
The charges against manning include the beneficiaries of the fine , illegal publication of secret information on the internet , the transmission of national defense information and theft of public property or documents .
He is found guilty of death in all charges , threatening a life sentence .
My Mexican American identity crisis .
Many People are forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the outcry - they call them heavy times .
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
I had just arrived in Mexico City a short trip to Mexico City and went to the passport control , when I saw a lot of guilt .
The two waiting dogs are on two waiting lines : one for Mexico &apos;s &quot; Mexicanos &quot; , another for &quot; Extranjeros &quot; ( &quot; foreigners &quot; ) .
I went there a few seconds , insecure , to which I should go .
I grew up in Central California and I was called &quot; Mexicans &quot; for my whole life .
A ethic shortcut - just as my friends in Boston &apos; Iren &apos; or my friends in New York &apos; Italians &apos; .
I then decided to &quot; Mexico &apos;s American &quot; .
But that was Mexico .
And in my grandfather ’ s home there was no need for shortcuts or hymns .
I was simply Americans .
I speak Spanish , at least good enough to say in this language on both ends of an interview .
But I do not have a vocabulary of a native speaker , and I will not be a Member of this House .
So I took my American passport and took me to extranjeros .
I thought this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama .
The agenda has all been asked to deal with the two countries ’ heads , namely immigration , drugs and trade .
Pena Nieto was also interested in talking about the growth of Mexican economy , and is a reason why Mexicans are now staying with as much chance in Mexico as they are in the United States .
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc to the European Union .
And Pena Nieto is not to continue to pursue Mexico ’ s war on the drug cartel , even if he has no details on this .
Mexico relations with the United States are complex and full of fun .
Most Americans probably wasted a single thought that the United States entered Mexico in 1848 , and that the country ’ s leaders had forced to leave them over half of their territory .
But for Mexicans , who are in centuries and not in minutes , memories of this event are not overlooked .
So , once a US government official has only a mild criticism of Mexico , one is heard - in Mexican press and among the elites of the country - about how Americans are to be buried by the sovereignty of their neighbour country .
And the children of Montezumas are on the wardrobe .
Yet Mexico ’ s greatest challenge is the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States .
Want to talk about resentment ?
There is more than enough .
Mexico has winners and losers , people for whom the country offers opportunities , and others for which it does not .
The only reason why the only reason why the people of cities such as Los Angeles , Las Vegas , Phoenix , Denver and San Antonio live , is that one person - perhaps a parent or grandmother - has not given a chance in Mexico , and has emigrated to the north .
And in most cases , this person contacted a profile - dark , uneducated , out of a poor village , etc .
We are the descendants of these people , and our loyalty is
Not Mexico .
And , while we may now have a good school , a good school , and have good jobs , we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we live - not the Mexican .
Our identity is sometimes blurred , but we are not the case about our loyalty .
This is clearly the United States .
Moreover , we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership are not so .
This is based on reciprocity .
They see us as a humiliating defeat and look to us because we are not Mexican enough .
Our Spanish will never be good enough to have our banties to Mexico never strong enough
In our opinion , our existence is a symbol of failure .
If our families had failed in Mexico , they would not have gone .
And then we would not be caught behind the silk curtain - with a pleasant life in the United States , but somehow lost .
My wife , who was born in Guadalajara and who was a child in the United States , reminds me that there are tensions between Mexico and Mexican Americans , because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are , and Mexican Americans are doing so .
While she is a national citizen , she looks like part of two countries .
But many Mexican Americans , I know , have the feeling of not belonging to one another or another .
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte , but Bruce Springsteen .
One enjoys the best of both worlds , but is not rooted in any of them .
We are seen as Americans in Mexico .
And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans .
As I should learn during my trip , there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated : some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational community want to resume their connections to the diaspora .
They want to use Mexican Americans as a provisional ambassador to Mexico , which is defending their interests in the United States .
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico .
Now
This will not happen .
Too many wounds .
And , given the unequal income distribution , unbridled corruption and drug violence , many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country .
I fear you have to be alone through Amigos .
That is fair .
If , at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to give the United States a century to deal with Mexico , they must accept that some Mexican Americans have a huge amount to be held to deal with their family members not so long ago .
Hmmm
Perhaps we are &quot; Mexican &quot; when I thought .
New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas may prove to be an unexpected foundation for peace .
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East
The latest bloody events seem to stir such hope in the bud .
In the midst of the usual debt , countless buildings were put in ruins , and more than 140 Palestinians , most of them civilians , and six Israelis , and the first time missiles were killed from Gaza in Gaza , near the Israeli metropolitan and the sacred city of Jerusalem .
But , while Israelis and Palestinians appear to be capturing their historical conflict , the Middle East is changing around them
The Arab Spring has created a new , unambiguous situation , and whether it wants it or not , and Israelis and Israelis are part of this effort .
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed .
But there are reasons for assuming that the deadly pad can finally end .
A War that is Not lost or won
At first sight , optimism seems to be far from being appropriate in the current situation
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November , this week ’ s fighting has strengthened the hard-won on both sides .
Hamas ’ s leaders , the Islamist movement that has been controlling Gaza since 2007 , will be determined to resurrect Israelis , even though their group itself has suffered major losses .
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza are being invaded in one of the most diluted and most densely populated corners of the planet , Israel has not managed to destroy Hamas .
Indeed , Hamas is being added to the West Bank , controlled by the rival , moderate Palestinian Fatah .
And Hamas leaders may conclude that they have time on their side .
As Islamists in the Arab world have gained influence , Hamas has powerful and rich friends to move .
Turkey , a reviving , regional power that once considered itself the most powerful Muslim ally , has taken Hamas , just like Qatar , one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf States .
The Hamas ’ s Islamist half-brother believe that the Lebanese militia is a Muslim , far from Syria , where there are rebels , where Rebellies could threaten an increasingly Islamist pre-empt of Bashar Assads , to Jordan , where Hamas-allies threaten the king .
And , in particular , the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the most common and most important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region .
Hosni Mubarak , the laizist despot that ruled Egypt for 30 years to his fall , had little time for Hamas .
By contrast , the Brotherhood is blamed with Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular views .
In future diplomatic negotiations , Hamas could be a player that can not be exterminated by Israel and the United States .
The Israeli hardliner , on the other hand , is a opposite
Hamas is not a danger to Hamas .
The Israeli missile defence system , Iron Dome , has proved itself to be a good thing , and many of the Hamas-rockets have been destroyed
At least for a while , Israel will be able to sleep quietly
Diplomatically , the United States is unruly in its position , and many European countries have held Hamas responsible for the latest violence .
Israel has been well acquainted with it in recent years , especially Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu , who has ignored the peace process
Although the Gaza Strip has been killing about 30 Israelis , the country has been in a position to be relatively free of suicide attacks , not least because of the blockades that took place in the West Bank and thus in the main part of any Palestinian state , which , although it was declared to be a non-aggression , is still being used to protect the Jewish settlements , which are being
Netanyahu is well there , and his Likud party , in the run-up to the elections on 22 January , was interviewed with an even more struggling group .
Why do these abrupt Palestinians also bush and leave their own state ?
If they had really control over the West Bank , would they not be able to fire rockets , just like their fellow fighters in Gaza ?
No , it is better to keep them in the wall behind the wall and to punish them , if they dare to lift the heads .
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to assert themselves , but the Arab Spring could give them a sense of balance
Even if the Islamists who are now sitting in power in Egypt and elsewhere are not left to Israel , they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country .
Israel ’ s defense mandate is greater than its four Arab neighbours .
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to repair their economies .
The fact that pragmatic President Morsi met with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era .
Israelis should also think longer-term .
While the rest Arab world is taking steps in the direction of democratisation , Palestinians are being deprived of their self-determination rights - a powder fass that , one day , will no doubt explode in the Israeli occupied territories , just as this week exploded a bus in Tel Aviv .
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state , and the Arab population is going to exacerbate this situation .
High missions to Hamas ’ s withdrawal in Gaza are increasingly demanding their diplomatic triumph over the years .
Both sides need to be an External Action
The right answer is those that are being represented by the more reasonable representatives of both parties , most of the world and this newspaper : two countries where Israel is to be subject to security .
The hope that the ceasefire is now small - hope that the ceasefire is more powerful in order to implement this solution .
Egypt must now be able to sit down with Turkey and Qatar , and to put the weapons of mass destruction in Gaza , and to be more positioned than ever to persuade Hamas to be able to persuade Hamas to be a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders , supplemented by the
Outstanding Arab nations should also move to an agreement between Hamas and Fatah .
This would more to create a Palestinian state than to the forthcoming request for UN observer status .
Obama , too , must help to negotiate Israel .
During his first term , he failed to interpret his own peace plan .
Whoever is away in the white house seems to be taking part in an engagement .
But this is a regrettable , short-sighted perspective .
The United States has a major interest in a stable Middle East .
This is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians .
Expensive legislation on cigarette packets
Health warnings and sick parts of neutral green packs that are identical to all tobacco brands .
The world &apos;s first legislation on the common cigarette and tobacco packaging has been replaced by a neutral , olive-green label , which is replaced by neutral , olive-green , which is also printed with drastic images , which are prone to sick body parts and to cigarette smoke , which are malicious and children .
From the different health warnings and pictures , from next Saturday there is the only difference between the packages in the brand name , which are printed in identical , small printed form .
Australia is thus introducing the world &apos;s strictest regulations on tobacco packaging .
The Australian Federal Government wants to reduce the smoking of young people by removing the glamour of tobacco consumption .
The government is proceeding with studies that show that people who do not yet have a 25 years to smoke will not be able to start smoking with 99 % of them .
&quot; You can also see that you are looking for the message to the tobacco companies , &quot; says Federal Minister for Health , Tanya Plibersek , who quotes studies , which , for example , show that children have the crown of a logo associated with the idea of a princess .
Although Australia has one of the world ’ s lowest smoking standards and the changes are only slightly affected by the profits of multinationals , other countries are already considering similar steps .
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the legislation .
It was said that the laws would promote the trade in black and white products , which would lead to cheaper and easier to live cigarettes .
&quot; The laws will lead to serious , unintended consequences &quot; , says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia .
Chinese and Indonesian counterparts will offer far more quantities of these products on the streets of Australia .
Others say , however , that the laws have boosted their business
Sandra Ha , a small family company , has shown that the demand for cigarette and silicone packaging , which is a great deal of attention to British American Tobacco , since the British American Tobacco , British Tobacco , Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco , a major exporter of the most recent Australian , have failed to comply with the laws .
Zico sold up to 6,000 units in wholesale stores and warned of new stocks .
For us , this is a good deal .
Experts , according to the fact , are the hook in the popularity of social media , with the very population that is planning
A series of Australian companies banned tobacco companies from being banned from advertising , and most of the dealers are forced to stop cigarettes in shops , and now tobacco advertising is being replaced .
The Australian Government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and websites , but has no influence on international sites .
&quot; If you are a market and you are not going to be able to apply for your products , then you will be able to apply to the Internet , &quot; says Becky Freeman , research researcher in the health
Freeman has an increasing experience of the brands of &quot; normal people &quot; , as well as a growing experience of the social media , such as YouTube , Twitter and Facebook
One has to ask : is it just a private person , so big everyone to marlboro cigarettes , that she even has a video - or has a marketing agency to do so ?
British American Tobacco Australia says that industry is focusing on new laws rather than marketing .
It has even gone as far as to pay Ukraine , Honduras and the Dominican Republic to the new rules , and those countries complain about unfair trade restrictions at the World Trade Organisation , although none of the countries are doing more trade with Australia .
A WTO decision will be expected for mid-2013
According to Plibersek , the government has held talks with other countries which consider similar packaging legislation .
Canada was the first country to propose photographic warnings in 2001 .
Meanwhile , they have been extended to more than 40 countries , including Brazil , Turkey and Ukraine .
Higher laws are considered in Britain , New Zealand , South Africa and India .
Many Australian smokers are tending to be dry .
The pictures do not affect me .
I simply ignite them .
&quot; You just take a pinch and put it off , &quot; Victor El Hage says when buying a cigarette box , where a photo is printed with a mundtumor .
Frankly , there is only one reason why I would stop , and that is my little girl .
James Yu , owner of the tobacco trade &quot; King of the Pack &quot; in downtown Sydney , says that the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill its shelves .
&quot; I took an hour to subscribe to a delivery , now I need four , &quot; says Yu .
&quot; The government should simply ban cigarettes - then we would have been told okay , this was &apos; s , we &apos;re going to make it &quot; , he clearly bypassed
It is beautiful to be a good , even electrified world , even when it is not so electrified .
I spent five hours in the airport , when we had a plane because of mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flying .
I had enough time to get some ideas .
I do not want to lie .
A half day on the airport is quite annoying - even if books , magazines and iPhones are available ( and of course tax-free shopping ) .
But more and more academics and child development experts are running out of a positive .
If it goes to them , it is for us - and our children - okay to be occasionally bored .
This is a force that forces the brain to lose in interesting ideas , which may promote creativity .
Because most of us are almost constantly strolling on one or more of our screens , the benefits of boring are no longer our benefit .
So why should we welcome the lover to open arms ?
Yes
No .
I will return to that again .
Like many people , I have always assumed that borrowers are now a relatively current phenomenon , which has evolved into a more modern life .
But Peter Toohey , Professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and the author of &quot; Boredom : A Lively History &quot; ( Yale University Press , 2011 ) does not see this .
&quot; In fact , the boredom has a very long history , &quot; he says
The Pompeii house walls are decorated with Latin graffiti , which dates back to the first century .
And there is the question of how we actually define it .
John D. Eastwood , an associate Professor of Psychology at the University of York in Ontario , Canada , has the problem that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways .
After a long reading of research literature and presenting the idea of a focus group of about 100 people , Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that the experience of being a good , &quot; good , &quot; is not to be defined .
So apathy is now different from apologies , so that the person is not employed , but he wants to be .
On the other hand , apathy does not make a stop .
The key experience of the boredom is that he is in a &quot; disturbing the attention process , coupled with bad mood and the feeling that time is slow &quot; .
So it is almost impossible to hear such a depression .
But Professor Eastwood believes that , although these two conditions may be associated , people have the problem in their surroundings or the world , while depressive people see the problem in themselves .
Sometimes we feel that we are boring , even though we are not yet in a position to concentrate ourselves .
In the survey , in the study &quot; The Undisturbing Boredom in Terms of Attention &quot; , for example , the concept of &quot; The Unintentional on Psychological Science &quot; , which appeared in September , appeared in the magazine &quot; Perspectives on Psychological Science &quot; , and his colleagues showed an early experiment in the event of a band , where a person lectures a magazine article .
Some of the groups heard a loud television program from the adjacent space , which had nothing to do with the content , others heard it to be low volume , so it was almost invisible , while the third group did not take this noise out of the box .
The people who had hardly heard about television , said more boring than the two other groups - they had problems to concentrate , they could not find any reason for them and write their difficulties .
If you are trying to concentrate on a difficult or hard task , please , consider the disruption of the attention , Mark J. Fenske , associate Professor for Neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario , and one of the authors of the study .
But if you are exercising a one-sided activity - &quot; as you search for flawed products on a factory , you can divert music and help not to feel bored &quot; .
In fact , he says , we know that herbs and krits are often interpreted as a sign of boredom , even to be able to fight them by being physically more attentive .
&quot; Studies have shown that children who are hamping around , learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit down , such as Professor Fenske .
We all have a long time - my delayed flight , a rugged loudspeaker , a very tired film .
But some people often have more to be done .
To measure these differences , researchers in the 1980 ’ s saw a &quot; scale for Langeleverage &quot; .
On the scale there are statements like &quot; Many things I must do , repeat and are monoton &quot; and &quot; I have so many interests that I have not enough time for everything &quot; .
With such scales , researchers have found that boys are bored to be bored as girls , Stephen Vodanovich , professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida , especially , in terms of the need for more and broader variety of external stimuli .
But in general teenagers are a pretty abrupt stumbling .
In 1991 Reed Larson , professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois , made an experiment with almost 400 teenagers and their parents contacted with a pager seven to eight times a day .
He found that 32 % of the elderly in school and in the case of homework were married , whereas there were 23 % to be married , when they were not in school .
But only 3 % of parents said to feel bored .
Professor Larson says today , 21 years later , he knows whether the percentage share has increased or dropped .
But he is sure that &quot; youth will be especially boring &quot; , mainly because children and teenagers have no major influence on their everyday lives .
So , then , to my question of my own country of origin : Is it healthy
Sometimes , because in extreme cases it does not lead people to take extreme risks and to lose gambling or drugs to alleviate them - as has been shown by studies .
On the other hand , many philosophers and authors are investigating the relationship between boredom and creativity , which is Professor Vodanovich , who has been researching the subject for more than two decades
&quot; With the lover , the brain is going to say something else should be done &quot; , so Gary Marcus , professor of psychology at the University of New York .
But the brain does not always know what should be done best .
If a boring is and you use this energy to play guitar and cook , you will be happy .
But television can in the short run provide a sense of happiness , but it is exploiting in the long run
So , if you are a child , you can get to know the girls , but you can &apos;t get to know them .
And he adds : &quot; Self-control is passing on to the other &quot; .
The child not only learns to talk , but also gets more self-control in other areas .
I do not believe that we should borrow .
Nor should we be too critical of it .
Instead , our goal should be to be able to feel comfortable from the constant activity-based and technological correction .
Professor Eastwood agrees to that .
&quot; It sounds like a long time , but it is a bit boring , but it is a bit of a bit of a bit to do something meaningful &quot; , he says .
He believes that people are only looking for a way to go , to relax and to relax .
&quot; In an environment in which we are constantly over-stimulated , it is difficult to deal with the fact that the noise is being squeezed .
There is no clear guideline for the new Marihuania network in Colorado
The 19-year-old Community team and football player Anthony Orozco is in the South-Colorados for a crime that will soon be legal in that state , which will soon be legal : ownership of some of the less-than-puppies and a pipes that he will smoke .
Orozco , he was a student and a few friends on a September day with car in Lamar near the border with Kansas , when they were stopped .
After the police officer Marihuana was found in car , Orozco was charged with possession of drugs and drug utensils - cavalieres , each with a penalty of 100 USD - and received a sentence .
&quot; We are treated like criminals &quot; , so Orozco .
But is he also ?
In the days following the decision by the country to legalise small amounts of marijuana for own use , the answer to hundreds of smaller drug crimes is less the law than the location .
Hundreds of legal uneasiness that are turning to Marihuana are already being dropped here and in Washington , which are authorised by similar measures .
The police authorities no longer pursue their possession over 21 years , and this is legally allowed as soon as the new laws enter into force in the next few weeks .
But prosecutors in the conservative districts of Colorados have announced that existing marijuana sites continue to follow and that people still are being tried .
At the same time , several cities , from the suburbs to the Western Mountains , are voting to prevent new , state-sponsored Marihuanagjute from opening their communities .
&quot; This situation is so fast that I do not know what will happen next , &quot; says Daniel J. Oates , Secretary of State in Aurora , who is east of Denver .
Regulators in the Federal State of Washington are also scratching their heads steadily .
They are waiting for guidance to establish a licence system for production , production , distribution and sale of the drug - and to be able to do so by 1 December 2013 .
In Washington , it is believed that Colorado is in any case ahead of the majority of countries in terms of regulating Marihuana , where the drug was legalised only for medical purposes and then for private use .
&quot; Colorado has a more regulated market , &quot; says Brian E. Smith , Speaker of the Confederation for Spirituous Cities in Washington .
But Smith also states that no place or system can do more than serve as a rough guide .
&quot; We do not have a true precedent , which we can follow , &quot; adds .
The Washington Act , called I-502 , enters into force on 6 December , thus also constitutes the end of a grey zone in which the State Licenses System is not yet there , but ownership is legalised .
And unpleasant practical issues are to be resolved in this period , such as the state of the need to be able to obtain a &quot; reasonable access &quot; to the ban on the use of cannabisic activities , which are to be used in the surrounding areas of 300 meters around schools , parks , games
&quot; Nowhere will it be harder to find a site for a licensed cannabisisy business than in urban areas , especially in the Ballenry area of Seattle , says Ben Livingston , spokesperson for the Center for Legal Cannabis , a recently formed research group .
On 21 November , Chief Oates sent to his staff in Aurora an email , stating that the prosecutor would no longer pursue minority marijuana elites over 21 years , and that the police will not seek to seek criminal offence for these crimes .
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to pursue urban plans to regulate the regulation of migrant farmers from Mediaanic Marihuana and to continue prosecuting drug traffickers
In Weld County in the north Colorado , district prosecutor Ken Buck is a more rigorous opinion
After the vote , he agreed that his authority would continue to pursue cases of Marihuanabesitz , mainly to move consumers to the fore .
At present , 119 persons have to be held responsible for the possession of about 50 grams or fewer Marihuana , although many have also been charged with other crimes .
&quot; Our authority has a duty to prosecute infringements , which were the subject of criminal acts , &quot; Buck said in a statement .
The reactions are even in places like rural Mesa County , where voters rejected the Marihuana initiative .
The police in Grand Junction , the largest city in the country , does not show adults any longer to possess smaller quantities .
Pete Hautzinger , a lawyer , supported this decision , but it decided not to leave all the outstanding acquis .
&quot; I do not think I can continue to enforce my time , to enforce the right to change , &quot; he says .
Although 55 % of the voters in Colorado supported the measure , it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of Marihuana with the complexity of government and legal system .
And the conflicting reactions across the country gave a profound boost to the public , with the large green experiment .
The government of the country is a &quot; cultural barrier &quot; , which is a &quot; cultural barrier &quot; , which is a lawyer from Denver , a lawyer from Denver , who represents and is a spokesperson for the national government on the reform of Marihuanada .
&quot; You have spent so much of their lives on prosecuting people to prosecute their legalization , &quot; he says .
As the first countries to treat small quantities of marijuana as alcohol , Colorado and Washington are treated as national examples of legalizing drugs .
While the advocates and officials are preparing for an age of legal sales , they are also nervous at the instructions of the Federal Government , which will continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a crime .
The advocates of the Legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give way
Despite several findings by consumers and sellers of medical marihuanas , the Federal Government has allowed the sale of medical Marihuana in Colorado , Washington and 16 other countries , mostly .
Kevin A. Sabet , former Obama ’ s drug minister , is probably not a man of the administration of criminals , but it is likely that there will probably be no doors to confiscate small quantities of drugs , but will probably be forced to do so under the new legislation that is legally regulated by the country ’ s state-regulated marijuana
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for the federal authorities to act .
Even before the election day , some local government officials allowed Moratoria to be used for new marijuana operations , although they could only open in about a year .
Last week Montrose , a city in the West , decided to ban a six-month ban , which is probably being adopted next week .
&quot; We do not want to be a position where we are licensed and then there is a major problem at the federal level &quot; , Bob Nicholson , member of the City Council .
Our community has voted against this amendment .
We are doing what the community has decided and not after what the government has decided .
Many questions are still outstanding .
Petronella Wyatt : I was mobbed by Oxford , because I was Tory .
Not only university students of today are attacked for their views .
It was always my greatest dream to get a place at Oxford University .
Both my father and my older brother , I was visiting the University , which I once held for the world &apos;s largest science stamp , for a modern Greek symposia that promotes the great pillars of civilisation - free thinking and tolerance .
But in two weeks after my arrival in the Worlester College at the late 1980s - there I had had to study history - I had packed my suitcase again and brought to the first scandal of my life .
My father collapsed in tears .
My friends were confused .
The Evening standard was said to have gone because I had a problem that there would have been some sex in neighboring rooms .
The author A N Wilson declared that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged masses .
But the truth was less amusing .
I went away .
Yes , because I suffered from systematic harassment and threats .
Not because of my very unusual name , or because I came from a private school .
I was harshly harshly harshly shifted to one reason , which seemed to be a source of confusion and cruel , and I was a shy father , Woodrow Wyatt , who had been an important adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I am a Conservative .
Why do I mention this now ?
Now , reports , according to reports , a new generation of students of moderate rights suffers from similar persecution
The organised and growing hatred of Torey students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them has called for the same equal rights protection for the gays , the disabled and ethnic minorities last week .
Conservatives of the Junior Common Room ( JCR ) of Corpus Christi College are often used to be actively isolated , personally attacked , and declared unwanted due to their political views .
They call for a place in their College ’ s Equity Committee to ensure that their opinions are freely expressed .
Her situation was exacerbated by a recent documentary on political students on BBC Two , &quot; Wonderland : Young , Bright and on the Right &quot; , which was the Tories of Excentrians and Neonazis .
This was shown by the former graduate Joe Cooke , former President of the Conservative University of Oxford , who was a student of a Rolls-Royce , and was projected with silver and silver stockings .
Other universities say conservative students , they are considered to be &apos; scapegoats for introducing higher study fees &apos; .
The 20-year old Luke Black , Vice President of the University of Nottingham , said in a Sunday newspaper : &quot; There is a growing link of universities .
People think we are like the Bullingdon Club without having got to know us .
Samuel Roberts , 21 and historian of the House , who initiated the “ unpleasant ” , and who are a “ unpleasant ” , and who , in 19-year-old , and former president of the conservative student association of Oxford , called upon him to be a growing opposition to students of the moderate right .
&quot; This poses a danger to the intellectual discourse and to the welfare of members , &quot; she says .
In my first week in Oxford I was a minority of such .
I was a brilliant 18 year old and came to the city in September 1986 .
The hatred to the Conservatives had reached its peak .
In the year , the university voted to give Margaret Thatcher , a former student , no honorary debt due to cuts in university .
The atmosphere would even have shaken Stalinists .
In the first days of the first semester week , when the new students met and the tutors met , I got a taste of what happened to the future .
I made the experience that the Tutors not only tolerated the spotting of Torah students but also took part in them with joy .
Political issues such as the mining dispute , privatization and the refusal of the government to impose sanctions against South Africa ’ s apartheid regimes have their way into the manslaughtered areas of the Tutorial .
I should translate French texts from the 18th century to English , and to what I was not going to be writing .
&quot; Miss Wyatt &quot; , said the tutor Harry Pitt ( now dead ) , &quot; translate the first paragraph &quot; .
I stumble .
Pitt was a small man with a face like a cow , and rather a bit hurt .
&quot; Feel like Thatcher followers , or are they just stupid ? &quot; he asked me .
The other students saved .
I think that the tears are screwed
&quot; I suggest that you take a few French hours in your leisure hours - so if you are not too busy with your social activities , I &apos;m scarcely interested in putting my mind on .
I returned to my room with hanging head .
On this evening I sat alone at college , when I was slightly on the shoulder .
It was an English student from the second year called James , who was a member of the Conservative Association .
&quot; I know who you &apos;re , &quot; he said .
Unfortunately , it is .
Anyone who is suspected of being a tory is being harassed .
I am bad enough , but you know that your father is Margaret Thatcher , so it will be worse for you .
Most of the Torey first semester are to be the Labour Party .
I tried to be a local pub later .
I was not in agreement with Mrs. Thatcher on all points .
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful .
A student in the field of philosophy , politics and economy , who , ironically , had visited the most conservative Eton College , said to me : &quot; You are the daughter of a fascist encirclement .
They are polluted .
Other students shared his opinion .
I was perverse and dreaming .
&quot; How have Tories Sex ? &quot; asked me .
Are they mutually exclusive ?
I felt like homosexuals had to feel more liberal in the United States .
Would I ever be able to lead a normal life at Oxford University ?
Can I not be able to meet people after a breakthrough ?
Should I be subject to the Labour Party and to suppress my own natural incitement ?
The three years before me , spread to my spiritual eye to a feeble of apostasy and isolation .
The only tutor to be seen as a tory was Norman Stone , a professor of contemporary history , who had his seat in my college .
He was not only a conservative , but also a conservative , and he was discussing foreign policy and writing speeches .
He was rarely there .
He hated the place , he was a provincial and subtle , and he rejected him for his marxist , deterministic history .
In 1997 he took a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara .
&quot; You will not be happy here , &quot; he said .
I started to punch between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge in the open and family members in the city .
My father told me that I hate Oxford and why I did it .
He seemed unwise .
Throughout his time , all political views were accepted .
&quot; But it is the best place in the world &quot; , he said .
Such things would never happen , not in my city of the dreamy tower peaks .
Even my communist friends always set good store .
His motive eyes turned out .
Give a chance to the whole .
I am sure you &apos;re just bursting .
I would break the heart if you &apos;re running .
My frequent travel to London has been weakened by my emotional resistance .
One of my male friends , also Torry supporters , had given up pressure and told his convictions .
During a week of a tutorial , in which another history of history had seriously claimed that I was a &apos; enemy of the people &apos; , I decided to do the same .
Although I went to the scene before Scham zerging , I had to admit that my parents had undergone a &quot; brain slave &quot; and called &quot; old trottoes &quot; .
The relief was only a short one .
It was my father who brought the last nail into the Sarg of my Oxford career .
At that time he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press each week .
My door was closed .
I hidden my room and after five minutes my chickens stopped .
When she went , I packed a box and took the first train to London .
I never returned .
I am happy to give you a wake-up slut .
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer from such intimidation and cruelty in an educational institution .
And even more tragic is that Oxford was a university that not only created 14 Torey Prime Ministers , but hitherto hijacked a unfounded reputation of equality and freedom of thought .
&quot; Valentino attracts elegance of celebrity &quot;
On the occasion of the exhibition &quot; Valentino - Master of Couture &quot; , opened in London this week , ABC talks with Naty Abascal , Fiona ThyssenKrupp Bornemisza and other famous customers of Italian fashion makers .
Somerset House , the former residence of Isabel I of England , is the only place in the British capital , which is worthy of holding an exhibition on Valentino Garavani .
This has been recognised by the designer at the opening of &quot; Valentino - Master of Couture &quot; , a magnificent retrospective , for which more than 130 clothes were assembled by the Haute Couture , created by his &quot; Maison &quot; in the last 50 years .
&quot; I love this palace &quot; , he says with its distinctive Italian accent .
This exhibition is the completion of a story whose only protagonist is &quot; il signore &quot; Garavani , but without his distinguished clientele could not have been written .
Valentino always felt fascination for the brilliant and distant world of the Adels .
In the first room of this exhibition , which will be held in the first part of March , there will be a lot of private letters and photos , starting from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan , about the Princantal Princantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon .
Valentino , as a trophies of his social career , shows this personal rise as a modemaker of the modest city of Voghera in northern Italy , to the Idol of the international
Being loadoaded in the adel must not be a disadvantage .
&quot; At least , they don &apos;t go on your wonderful carpet , like some beautiful celebrity of folk music , &quot; says Baroness in Fiona ThyssenKrupp -Bornemisza .
In the 1960s and 70s , the two were good friends .
Valentino is a spectacular , spacious and elegant host .
&quot; We all laugh to be invited to his house in Gstaad , &quot; explains the wife of &quot; Heini &quot; Thyssen , closely associated with forgotten beauty , such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos .
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of the famous .
Yet he is a star .
Valeria Mazza , in a dress of Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza is also not forgetting the charisma of the fashion maker .
Many years ago , after a fashion match , we went to the evening at Piazza di Spagna in Rome to dinner .
We were about 20 people , including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr .
At every detail of his apartment , decoration , food and music , he felt and felt his influence .
&quot; All the intents felt important and loved , &quot; the &quot; Top model &quot; , which started its career during the week of Haute Couture in 1995 in Paris .
&quot; He never comes out of fashion because his designs are artworks &quot; she says .
The Past of Origin
Garavani ’ s life is not a history of oblivion , rather of mutual love .
He likes to have good education and the highest tires and she love him .
One of the most beautiful features of the hotel is the fact that the first of the three artists , the artist , who was a member of the family , was the first to be able to enjoy the music of the artist , who was a great fan of the song . The song was inspired by the song “ Audit ” , which was used to create a wonderful and intimate atmosphere , which was inspired by Aristóteles Onassis , the Monica Vitti in &quot; La Notte &quot; , or a pint of the song &quot; La Notte &quot; , the music of the artist , who was a great friend of the artist , who
In this audience of Mostiusks , there are numerous names such as Sibilla de Luxemburgo , Gloria of Thurn and Taxis , Mette Marit of Norway , Rosario , or Sofía von Habsburg .
Naty Abascal and Modemacher , 2006
Many of these people say , the first Valentino is like the first love , &quot; unforgettable &quot; .
I can remember perfectly well .
It was a trout , a shirt , a Weste type &quot; Gillette &quot; and a jacket from the autumn / winter collection 1971-1972 .
&quot; It was a gift of him &quot; , says Naty Abascal , one of the designers of the designer .
&quot; I prefer him to all others because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty , &quot; adds to the ex-hearth in Feria .
I like the colors he uses , very much ; they have a lot of light and underline the face
The proportions are perfect .
The Princess and Concerto Patricia della Giovampaola d &apos;Arenberg , too , can not forget the first time they took a Valentino .
When I lived as a teenager in Italy , I dreamed of having the time and the opportunity to wear one of his clothes ...
After the 1990s , it came to the end .
I bought my first Valentine dress for a festivity in the castle of my vetoes , the Prince Edouard de Ligne .
It was a red dress with flying rock and a draped upper part with a decolleté , making his name a good one .
&quot; It was a true dream &quot; , says the widow Rodrigo d &apos;Arenberg .
&quot; Valentino does not depend on fashion , its obsession is timeless &quot; , explains this Italian Aristocracy , which lives between Parisian , New York and Buenos Aires .
The Princess D &apos;Arenberg keeps her evening clothes in the fashion , &quot; with absolute care &quot; , &quot; because a dress is not just a dress , but also the memories associated with it &quot; .
The King &quot; King &quot;
The great finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995 .
Four months of work and 25 &quot; Ragazze &quot; ( as the Modemacher called his guests ) were necessary to produce this ostrich flavor with pearls , twelve different embroideries and a four-and-a-half m long .
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes , the highest authority of the professional press , this dress was a milestone in Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century , &quot; the return to the top of society &quot; .
For years , the elite has cheated with the &quot; savoir-feel &quot; of the elite , Valentino is now her best copy
Cavaliere di Gran Croce , Cavaliere del Lavoro , Cavaliere del Lavoro , Commandeur de L &apos;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres , distinguished with the honorary , he cumulates Garavani as many honors as any of his hometown .
&quot; I always know his refinement , his calm , his well-cared and perfect appearance &quot; , gives D &apos;Arenberg .
I saw him the last one month a month ago at a Gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay
He sat on the table of the Gernin Jacqueline de Ribes , a very good girlfriend of me
&quot; He was a mystery ; the time left no traces to him .
And this says a princess ...
The Worlest World ’ s Worlest : Human Working Cases of Kawah Ijen
For four euros , the Indonesian volcano agents are putting their lives and their health at risk when they carry 70 kilo sulfur over the steep , deep paths .
There are people for whom their work is hell , and others work in the hell .
This is the case of Anto Wijaya , one of the 400 mind-workers who earn their lives by getting sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java .
To do this , he must go down to the land of his kraters every day , where the sulphur sulphate gas is emitted into contact with the air .
After breaking large sulphur stones , which could be weighed up to 70 kilo , he transported them to two bamboo basins on his shoulder on the shutdown paths of stone .
It is only 250 metres to the tip of the volcano , which is a height of 2386 metres , but the erected carrier needs more than 40 minutes to climb the turtles , and to keep the balance and to take care of them , so that they do not slip and fall .
They know that every step can be taken to a French tour , which has been a triumph of the Kawah Ijen years ago .
Kawah Ijen minenworkers earn 5 eurocent for each kilo of sulfur they reduce .
On the other hand , they are moving to the streets of the tourist , which they are photographing like circus and run with the tired heavy basins three kilometres to the guard , which a minencompany has a little further below 1850 metres .
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi , which has since 1960 used the ancestors of the volcano and ( never better ) to exploit its workers , which they paid 662 Indonesian rupia ( 5 euro ) for each kilo of sulfur .
It is then sold to the oil rowers ( 83 Eurocent ) , because this mineral is widely used in everyday life , and is used to produce strawberries , fireworks , fireworks , and even to the shelves of sugar .
&quot; We are usually 70 kg , we get about 46,000 rupies ( 3.8 euros ) , and Anto explains that it is usually three routes a day .
For each track he takes three hours , he has completely succeeded , but at the end of the day he has together 138,000 rupia ( 11,5 euros ) .
What is a malicious reward for such a schizophrenic effort , but is threw three times what he would earn with the field of work .
&quot; The daily wage of miners here , where the coffee is paid , and the average monthly income of € 15,000 ( € 167 ) is a very high one , and the carrier , who previously worked as Maurer on the island of Bali , explains that he is not a man .
There , he returned to Banyuwangi , and the work was not so hard , and the work was done in Indonesia , which was in Indonesia , and that is why I was so important as the Swedes , who , in Indonesia , were to be killed in Indonesia , where I married a girl from Bali , where they are Hinduists , and I was given them to Java to convert them to Islam .
Anto , asthma , atmet with difficulty , hustet often and his eyes are riddled because of the toxic gases .
The 27 years of Anto has been on the kawah ijen for three years to his sulfate , whose sulfate has left him to his face , although he has left his face with a mask and special glasses .
Anto has asthma , atmet with difficulty , hustet often and his eyes are riddled out of the volcano due to the toxic gases .
This is the price that he must pay for achieving his dream .
&quot; I will work here for two years , because I will make a shop , or if you want to learn Spanish or French , he promises to be a more acceptable English .
This pleasant and intelligent young man , who is a tourist man , could work as a tourist guide , a waiter or a reception of a hotel , but instead he is doing the work of a trader
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other tears and is on two days at 2 p.m. , because the sulphur is also spread out , where its characteristic yellow colour is blowing in the dark .
The shadows are challenging , in the light of a small bullbule , he is going to crater in the light of his helm he bought from his own money .
About 400 carriers are loading the grain with sulfur on their shoulders .
Despite their great profits , mining companies did not mechanize sulphur mining to save costs , and supplies the tachlers who are paid on their own account and paid weight , no equipment .
They also receive no share of the 30,000 Rupia ( 2.5 euros ) , which will be charged to the guardian of this natural park , together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupia ( 1.2 euros ) , to the tourists who are to enjoy the volcano and the human tragesel .
&quot; This work is for the animals and not for the people &quot; , Madrusin , a proud , 42 years old , who has been working for three decades since leaving school on Kawah Ijen .
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he continues to carry out the money , &quot; as long as it goes &quot; , because he needs the money to educate three children aged 10 and 18 .
I will not go to pension , I will die here because the volcano was my whole life .
Even if the sweat is shiwling and the little ones are on the wall , and the little ones are getting to the bottom of the crater , they are not afraid to be exposed to serious diseases ... of course , apart from the usual respiratory problems , arthrose , pain in the knees and the
With its back on its back , Unainik is more capable of wearing 50 kg of its back .
Every day he and his companions are killed by 15 tonnes of sulfur , which are transported by three lorries by a horse path between the bush to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometres .
&quot; I will not go in pension , I will die here because the volcano was my life , &quot; explains Unainik , with his mouth wide open , where some teeth are missing .
He was born in 1865 and was a member of the German Society of Science .
Time is running , but the disorder is continuing generation in one of the world ’ s hardest professions : those who work as human laxel on Kawah Ijen .
Singapore needs Babies to Save the Economy
The Singapore are making the blame for not having children , for their careers , for the economy , and for the costs of homes and children .
&quot; The People &apos;s Republic must grow &quot; .
I am a patriotic husband , you are my patriotic grandmother : fill in our civil duty and create life !
It seems incredible that the verse is part of an advertising for minzbonbons , but it was , or even this very reason , that they were in Singapore a viral video on YouTube this year .
The rates are part of a rape song , local spells such as &quot; bao &quot; ( Laib ) are used to make a bad start in Singapore .
The advertising company BBH , which has turned the video , is sure that the advertising advertisement is a fun way to draw attention to the problem .
Her creative leader Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to their &quot; national duty &quot; .
This is something for the internet , so we had to be fun and fun .
This is the biggest problem in that country .
We are the poor in the world , so we realise that this is an issue that we have to deal with .
We knew that the government had tried to do a lot , such as the marketing of parades with pheromons or the organisation of speed-date ends ( fast flirts ) .
May I say that many of these ideas were creative , but they did not make a success .
So we thought : why do we not make a lot of creative use to deal with this problem , such as a rap ?
1.2
The government of Singapore is not easy to take this issue .
Every year , it has USD 1.300 for political measures to encourage citizens to get more children .
A package of government and family members grants up to $ 15,000 per child , extending maternity leave and distributive benefits .
But everything has not been successful yet .
Singapore is a rich , high-tech city in the southeast of Asia , which is also known for its conservative and strict social control .
According to its national national population , the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman .
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is also known as an implementation rate - was in 1976 .
So why are the Singapore not getting more children ?
Tan Wei Ming , director of the national and family policy of the national population , says that this is due to a &quot; better education &quot; and &quot; greater career opportunities &quot; .
&quot; This has enabled people to marry out and to form a family to form far more options in terms of life goals and set priorities &quot; , she explains .
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of individuals and to the relinquishing of marriage and birth , which is a result of a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore .
Meanwhile , an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in migration to counter the population &apos;s poverty has led to a resurgence of the local population .
In Singapore , there are websites where hardly crazy Xenophobia is blowing against many new migrants , especially against the Chinese , who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating .
Immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the governing party in Singapore has reached its worst election result since independence last year .
Since the elections , an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers .
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in birth rates has the familiar effects on a nation &apos;s economic growth , tax revenues , health costs and immigration policy , the example of Singapore shows unexpected consequences .
The government is trying to ensure that not many small apartments are built .
This has already had an impact on the housing market .
The Agency for Urban Development has started to control the number of small apartments known as &apos; shoe boxes &apos; and can be built in certain areas of the city .
These apartments have a living area of 46 square metres and show a great success .
However , there is concern that they can promote the life of the single entity and that they discourage the bystanders from building large housing for families .
But Lim Yew Soon , General Director of the EL Developers estate company , says that his &quot; shoe boxes &quot; are selling much faster than larger residential units .
They are so popular , and the units are sold more quickly , day and even weeks , than larger residential units .
This means that they are much better for our Cash Flow .
However , it is true that the new standards give developers clearer guidelines , which previously put obstacles in the way of building too many small residential units within a project .
Too much
Singapore is a city state .
Even if these new rules could lead to an increase in national fertility rates , talks with the Singapore countries working in the financial district are bound to be seen to have no major impact .
&quot; The people are strong , the apartments and also the education are expensive , so it is excited by many people &quot; says a young manager .
Children can get others .
&quot; It is important to me to have my own money and time &quot; says another , about twenty years old man .
Men and women are leading their careers , the stress and the costs of property and education as reasons for not having children .
So the Singapore has the last word when it comes to getting children - the government can do so much .
offline Private offline is online private

According to the dictionary , this is private property or &quot; private life &quot; , where you have the right to protection from any kind of interference .
What is private for someone under 16 years ?
How is this definition applied to its everyday life and social networks ?
Does he consider the dangers he is putting to the Internet when he makes known situations that he would not share in real life ?
El Periódico interviewed five young people aged 10 and 15 , who are often on the net .
In four of these cases they linked the term &quot; something very own &quot; on a personal level and &quot; on the right and the user &quot; when applied to the social networks .
&quot; My deepest secrets would not be known in a post &quot; says the ten years old Jorge in trying to explain the meaning of &quot; private &quot; in web sites such as Facebook , Twitter , hotmail and Windows Live Messenger , where he has been using accounts for two years .
&quot; These are very confidential secrets , my mother may know , but not the whole world , he confirms .
I invite you to upload pictures or pictures of games .
I also spend my time with friends .
&quot; I would not share a picture that is not from me , or someone who makes the dump &quot; he says .
The young is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos , naked , to publish crimes , or offensive or violent comments .
Jorge insures to know 35 friends who he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter .
Most are relatives .
This includes the mother who has the password to one of the accounts .
I sent to Twitter to express me and to write interesting tweets .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if someone answers me , I just laugh it &quot; adds to it .
&quot; The social networks are entertaining , I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or with friends .
He answers that he would never be an invitation by an unknown .
Even if he is a stranger to someone , he would ignore it .
The case of the 14-year José is different
The Teenager has user accounts in Hotmail , Facebook , My Space and Ask , and in Ask , he gives 20 of the people who he has not been able to know about his friend list .
&quot; This is not because we have something nice , for example music &quot; , he gives .
According to the boy , no one has made any observations or asked him to be given his address or telephone
&quot; If someone is charged or asked to be asked to leave me , I simply remove it from my account .
José reported to Ask after reading a recommendation in Twitter .
The young are not unaware of experiences that are known today as cyberbullies .
The acquaintance of a girlfriend was erected in a social network
They threatened him and demanded money .
He never knew who it was , he assured him .
According to José , the victim has not closed the account
&quot; He made it private &quot; .
He explains a series of steps to configure a user account securely .
Unlike Jorge , this boy would upload photos of friends in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations .
Yes , I would do so if he is unpleasant or wants to be dismissed .
&quot; But I know that this is cyberbullying &quot; explains .
Key questions
Marielos Porras , teacher for English with higher education and learning , believes that to educate children and young people , to be able to understand the purpose of social networks .
&quot; The Internet was created as a medium for searching information ; but with the appearance of these pages , the rules of play have changed , &quot; she says
Porras explains that the academic artist Marc Prensky , the owner of a master title in pedagogy at the University Yale University and the author of the Digital Native and Immigrants , formulate these concepts for the statement of the phenomenon .
The digital natives are they , the children and young people who have grown up with this technology .
&quot; We are the digital immigrants to teach them where we still learn &quot; he says .
He says that this is a complex subject , &apos; because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what is to be published , published or said , and this is at an age when the maturity is not sufficient . &quot;
&quot; You should also be a selective person if you are most important to be popular , to have thousands of friends without considering the consequences , add it .
According to the expert , the most effective way to teach children and young people is to teach them how to raise them , to give them a thought .
&quot; To tell you they do not do it , does not work &quot; , he says .
Porras then calls some options : there are things you don &apos;t tell a stranger , why do you make it on the internet ?
Or : would you like to be able to publish a picture of you , like you published a friend ?
Do you know what the other people are about to publish
Did you ask the other people before to have a picture of the party ?
And one more question : do you need to know what you are doing at every moment ?
Another point is to make sure they are able to act online as they do offline .
They are the same rules .
&quot; Someone outside the Internet is with respect , sanitation and other principles , and the same must be for the social networks &quot; , he explains .

Estuardo Guardia , University professor , Master teacher and educator , commented that it is essential that parents read the social networks ’ guidelines carefully .
If you understand all sections , they are well founded to help their children to talk about the importance of opening their own account on the internet .
&quot; For example , the age , or what you can share or publish &quot; he explains
Guardia , the children must not be reminded of the lesson &quot; You should not speak with strangers .
The Unfair Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The sixth summit of the President of South African nations ( Unasur ) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration , which was announced earlier and which , in theory , should be signed by the seven rulers present
In the first half of the year , the first of the two parties to the Unfair , the first of which was to be handed over to the Unfair , was to transfer it to the government , but subsequently to say that it was published on the Persian Government &apos;s website .
On the text , they expressed the view that the content of the President of Peru , Ollanta Humala , was set out in short explanations to the press
The access of journalists to information about the summit was limited at any time .
During the day , the image of the presidential meeting was only transmitted to the audience without tone with the announcement &quot; private sitting , limited audio &quot; .
The few information circulating among journalists was received by the press spokespersons of some of the governments present at the Unmet meeting , but not the Persian press spokesperson .
The only document that was circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents , which was prompted by hundreds of journalists from various national and international media , demanding more information .
The presidential representative of Peru sent an email to the President of Peru with the &quot; final declaration &quot; , but it was the statement of Humala , not the official document to complete the summit .
Last October , Peru hosted the II Summit of South America - Arab States ( ASPA ) , and , despite strong press , the press has not published the so-called statement of Lima , which was announced before , as little .
On the official website of ASPA , you can be convinced that the document was released last Tuesday .
On both international meetings , the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems would be available to journalists , but they would have a very limited access to information .
The summit also concluded a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment by the Court of Justice of The Hague , which deals with a border conflict between the two countries
The President of Peru , Ollanta Humala , and Chile , Sebastián Piñera , met with the IGH decision , which took place on Monday in The Hague , in the Hague , in the trial , which led Lima to Santiago , to listen to the pledges of both sides .
&quot; We will follow and run the judgment on the differences we currently find with this international court , &quot; said Humala , with his Chilean counterparts .
&quot; Chile has , and continues to be , a country that has to comply with international legislation , is seeking peaceful solutions to disputes , and has accused the international courts , adds Piñera and green Humala with a wooden print before the flags of both countries .
The confirmation of both President that after a decision on the IGH , after having been accused of a serious mistake on maritime borders with Nicaragua , which considered a serious mistake , it had taken up a complaint against Bogotá , which agreed to subvert the rulings of this international court .
At the summit there were the Presidents of Brazil , Dilma Rouseff , Venezuela , Hugo Chávez , Bolivia , Evo Morales , and Argentina , Cristina Kirchner .
Paraguay , who has been excluded since 2011 after the suspension of his President Fernando Lugo , was not part of the meeting .
The welcoming President , Ollanta Humala , opened the talks this morning and ended the summit shortly after the lunch time in Lima .
The Head of State , which was informed in the closing document , reported that 16 decisions and the action lines for 31 projects between the South American countries were set to a total of 17 billion dollars .
As regards the decisions made , it said that the Unasi countries will take significant steps towards the goal of a South American nationality , and we shall extend the decisions on residence rights .
He agreed to promote measures in the fight against the insecurity in cities and against organised transnational crime , as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America , and to act together and to act effectively in the event of natural disasters .
The crisis in Europe is not to allow economic consolidation ( Latin America ) to take place , but to extend our production capacity and to add to our peoples a better future , adding Humala .
&quot; We decided to give a series of 31 emblematic projects to give priority to spatial ties in South America and especially in rural and border areas ... and thus to unite our countries and to open new economies , ” the Peruvian President said in a statement .
Among these projects , there are also five Peruvian , which are on the crossroads of its territory to Brazil , and which are meant to provide two for a better connection with Ecuador , although it did not have any further details .
The final document also took up the political situation in Paraguay .
&quot; We hope that the election process in that country serves as a continuation of the Union of South American nations , which is currently being excluded .
The need for Latin America to continue to be an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations has been another aspect which has been highlighted at the summit .
In this sense , the President of Colombia , Juan Manuel Santos , said in the regional meeting of the meeting in Mexico that he met with his counterparts in Mexico , Daniel Ortega , on Saturday , to deal with the maritime conflict in a manner which was considered to be a respectful judgment by Mr Bogotá , in the case of
&quot; I may be meeting tomorrow ( Saturday ) with President Daniel Ortega , &quot; said Santos .
&quot; We will check all these paths - they are not exclusive , and also the agreement with Nicaragua , they are necessary talks with Nicaragua , &quot; he emphasized
&apos;I hope that President Ortega can say that we are going to be so civilised and respectful of this matter , &quot; adds Santos .
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico , where they intend to be present when the new President of this country , Enrique Peña Nieto , is present .
As part of the summit , the Defence Ministers of Defence met in advance to approve the 2010 Plan of Action , which is intended to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence of the region .
Argentina , Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador , Peru , Brazil , Uruguay , Venezuela , Chile , Guyana , Surinam and Paraguay are members of UNASUR , even if the latter country is currently excluded .
Peru has the Presidency at the time of the regional bloc
&quot; South America must learn in the integration of the citizens &quot; , says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador , Rafael Correa , confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal , with &quot; South America really can learn something from Europe &quot; .
Correa , who took part in the 6th Summit of the President of South African Nations ( Unmet ) , took part in the elections in Lima , declared that the European public television in Peru declared that Europeans were in the Second World War and in other disputes , and &apos; today is practically a
In this sense , he defended the project to create a South American nationality that is driving the members of the Unasur .
&quot; The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be the case , as is already the case in the Andean Community ; but there are still reactionary sectors that seek to return to the past , &quot; he warned .
President Ecuador also supported the reformation of the Organisation of American States ( OEA ) , which would reduce the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and to take into account those signed by the San José Convention on Human Rights .
The ones who teach themselves never commit to anything , and in return we are signing the South American .
&quot; It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has its seat in Washington and is being funded by the United States , &quot; he declared to be a reference to political asylum , which Ecuador granted to the founder of WikiLeaks , Julian Assange .
Correa assured that he did not regret that decision because he failed to conceal his principles , but to have his &quot; deep democratic values and views on human rights &quot; .
He added that there were justified suspicions that Assange was to be delivered to a third country and that his trial would not be respected .
He also criticised the Swedish justice , which he called for to be carried out on his territory for a crime that is alleged to be a sexual offence , while &quot; Swedish jurisdiction allowed him to be executed through a video conference that could be carried out through the embassies Ecuador &apos;s in London .
Correa declared that there would be a danger that the health and mental state of Assange would be affected .
&quot; Since he is in our message , I did not speak with him , but the ambassador told me that he has a light problem with the Lung , but no more serious , &quot; said the Head of State Ecuador .
However , there is a danger that it will be able to close physical and mental harm because it is caught in a narrow space and cannot carry out physical exercises .
&quot; This would impair the health of any human being &quot; , he added .
Correa admitted that the resolution to the effect that the peace of the country was granted to the government in London , which was granted to the government in London , to be granted to Ecuador , and that it was in the hands of Britain , Sweden and the European authorities in the hands of the United Kingdom , and it underlined that there was talk of a solution to the imprisonment of WikiLeaks .
We are not acting with human rights , we do not use this word in this case , but there have been constant discussions
&quot; The solution to this problem is in hands of Britain , Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe because of Assange , Baltazar Garzón , a series of proceedings on various European bodies , &quot; he declared .
And &apos; if Britain gives this carte blanche to the public tomorrow , I think it is done &apos;
And if Sweden had left Mr Assange on the message Ecuador in London or over Skype , as it was done by Swedish jurisdiction and in other cases , the problem is being dealt with .
Correa took the opportunity to confirm to the press and to say to the press that what he did not tolerate is &quot; the mediocre , the evil intent and the lies that are unleashed by freedom of speech &quot; .
&quot; The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the bad and perverse politicians , but bad journalists who seek and blackmail for profit , &quot; he said .
In this sense , he would like Ecuador to be congratulated not by such journalists , nor by the bankers or hegemonic and spear-hungry countries , and it took precedence to intensify the revolution in a re-election , to continue the path in this right direction .
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto at the Unasur in the Unmet , where he argued that the Organism must remain stable , and that there should be no opportunism and no more than a legally abrupt coup , because it has been destroyed by the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay .
President Ecuador also holds the wish of his Colombian counterpart , Juan Manuel Santos , who , now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague , who was suspected of negotiating with Nicaragua the maritime state of Nicaragua , to negotiate the two countries &apos; right borders , is entitled to &apos; absolutely justified &apos;
This judgment is not being implemented today .
This is a problem between a southern and a Central American state .
Confrontions are inevitable , but they must be overcome in pursuit of a common path
They must be treated comprehensively to overcome them and look forward to the future .
He also trusted the contention of the disputes about the Seegrencht between Peru and Chile , and said that &apos; it is right for Latin America to call on international bodies to take the decision , even if it is very hard to take the judgment , to the two countries .
With regard to the possibility that he will be a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador to achieve his third mandate , he agreed that he was so optimistic and pleased , although it is sometimes very difficult to say &apos; .
Correa assured that if he dismissed the elections in February 2013 , he would withdraw from political life .
Personally , I personally have never been interested , but in such a case of unfair circumstances , Ecuador can only be corrected by political power .
&quot; My political movement had the belief that I was able to guarantee that probable victory , so I must fulfil this responsibility , &quot; he said .
If I had to win , it would be my last period as President , I withdraw from public life .
This also applies if we lose .
&quot; This is the choice &quot; , he declared
Correa also took up the treatment of the health problems of Venezuela , Hugo Chávez , Cuba .
I have just spoken to the Vice-President of Venezuela , Nicolás Maduro , to tell me that he has gone to the planned routine treatment , and expected him to return to Cuba after the campaign .
&quot; It does not in any case mean a return to the state of the President Chávez &apos; , he commented
The Ecuadorian leader , in Lima , took part in the 6th summit of Heads of State and Government of the South American countries ( Unasur ) , which has been called for to achieve a higher regional integration to ensure sustainable progress , equality and security .
Aids are a dead disease today , after the death of Aids .
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the result : HIV-positive .
&quot; It was like a bomb , &quot; he says about the moment he was diagnosed with the diagnosis that he tried to weaken without any visible success .
He hides it before his family .
He decided to care for his illness and started to inform about it , and so he was so busy to celebrate his 43rd birthday .
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara ( HCG ) , which he came to after several battles in 1994
Fabrizio lives with the human immune virus virus ( HIV ) since 22 years , which was hard to imagine at the beginning of the 90s , when there were many doubts , few treatment opportunities and more stigmata .
At the time , even the director of a hospital of IMSS refused to adopt it , &quot; because it led to a dead end &quot; .
At that time AIDS was synonymous with death
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome also with quality of life
However , many people still have a hospital that has nothing to do with their disease and where the virus has already suffered damage and has exhausted its immune system and the victims of opportunistic infections .
31 years after the first reported , in the world , the success of the first reported cases , that the survival of a patient , and the survival of the general population , explained , &quot; he said , the head of the HCG unit , Jaime Andrade Villanueva , and he said that this information was supported by a prestigious scientific publication in April of this year .
The scientists , Andrade Villanueva , and the fact that , in 2008 , the scientists said that AIDS was a death of the child , and that the patient &apos;s health is not a death system , and that those who are not being treated in the way of treatment are having to be able to have a greater chance of being infected : up to 30 years , to 30 years , when a count of 200
Simply put , the above mentioned , that who receives the diagnosis of HIV in 25 years is entitled to &quot; safe 75 years , as long as it is under control &quot; , explained this expert .
To be able to properly identify this progress , it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans is an average of 76 years .
Even if the number of people who are dying of AIDS has significantly reduced in the past few years ( in Mexico , which lives from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 ) , it is true that , since the appearance of the Erasmus ( ONUSIDA ) , it has been a good thing that , since the appearance of the AIDS virus , it has been able to
In Jalisco alone , 255 people died in 2011 , and by May of this year , there are 187 deaths , but it is assured that there will be universal access to antiretrovirals since 2005 .
- Why are people still dying ?
- I do not think that the problem is access to treatment .
This is my opinion , and so is in our hospital .
At least in the last 12 years we have no problems with medicines , the problem is that people are in far advanced condition because they do not know their infections , that is in very late stages of the disease .
It makes a telling statement : &quot; New ten patients come to us , if they are accompanied by a complementary infection , and in order to affect global mortality , early diagnosis is necessary , and all those who need to be exposed to it are to be offered massive evidence of infection .
This proposal was the result of the fact that the experts and officials in the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida e de Prevención del Sida en de l ’ Estatal de l ’ Aegean , who had made a friend of him , who had already had to do so in the AIDS period , and even in the AIDS period , and even the body of the
Everything is different , if you know that you have AIDS .
Some people think they will die and they will not hear anything .
&quot; If I have to die , then I would like to die three times , &quot; said in my case
The change was to improve , I eat good , tap sport and take the medication .
Today , their parents only know that he had cancer .
I live a normal life like any other .
&quot; I am a good , but I am doing a lot , but I am doing a lot of work , and that is a responsibility for my health , and that I am sure that I have to say , that I agree with him , that he has to be able to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO , to be able to
They should be the test of the risk of risk , and the sooner they know , the better , the better , and when they know the diagnosis , they are to learn how to live responsibly .
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012 .
Condoms behind the
There are great holes in health programs and ordinary people , explains Ricardo Salazar , journalist of Guadalajara , who has adopted the HIV .
The most important is prevention .
In the areas in question , the distribution of condoms was actually increased ; once they were given individually , they are now giving us packages to a hundred bits , which is good , but there are still people who have no access to a condom , &quot; he said .
The risk to new infections is youth .
&quot; What is the need for a common job of social workers , &quot; orientated subjects , &quot; employees in schools , employees in pharmacies and the health system , who want to be out of the way , who are not to be excluded , insured the correspondent .
He proposed to redirect this inefficient distribution ; the condoms should not just be behind the ladder , but in public budgets in public toilets , often visited by young people .
It is not to promote the promotion of profit .
It is not to be paid to the beer and motel , as the Governor Emilio González has asked to question whether he would be distributed under his administration .
&quot; Sexuality is not the best thing ; it is the best to bring those condoms who already have a sexual activity &quot; , he put it on the point .
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases ( 12.158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV ) .
The state is nationally located on the fourth site of new and cumulative AIDS cases , and 13 cases in relation to HIV .
92 % of the cases of infection are on sex , 6 % over blood and 2 % perinatal .
It is estimated that 50,000 people with HIV live because there are 4 or 5 people in each registered case , and they are not aware of it .
After the Court of Appeal of the United States , which has confirmed the reformation of the liabilities of Vitro , which has been achieved through a trade agreement in Mexico , it is not a disastrous precedent for each national company with subsidiaries in the neighbouring country , which have problems in payment .
So it could be said that the procedures for the survival of companies that permit Mexican legislation are not valid in the countries of stars and Stripes in contravention of international agreements .
In practice , the judgment of the judge of the judge , Harlin Hale , in Bancarrotas in the Northern District of Texas on 15 June , has made it possible for Mexican companies to be subject to the seizure of their property beyond the Bravo River .
However , the decision opens the largest glass producer in Mexico to call the Supreme Court of the United States for three inconsistencies .
While the judge points out that creditors must be subject to the United States ’ right to bankruptcy , the Fifth Circuit ’ s appeal to the World Bank is the first to be the main trading process in Mexico .
The first point would be that international cooperation in cases of payment insolvency in the case of non-bank companies is not known .
In fact , the United Nations model for the unification of international trade law was created for this purpose , with the American Law Institute being used as a sleeve .
Secondly , the judgment that , without the votes of the companies , after recognising the liabilities of the bankruptcy of Vitro , the branches of Vitro , the majority of companies would not have been able to achieve the necessary majority for restructuring .
However , this possibility is recognised by Mexican laws .
Vitro is not the first to allow this scheme to be approved .
There are a half-dozen examples , including agreements mex and Comercial Mexicana , whose liabilities are confirmed by the Group of the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles ( Federal Institute for Trade Accountability ) .
It is also true that , after moving the votes of the parties to Vitro , the creditors of the banks , who were opposed to Vitro , the victors , such as the Geier Fund , Aurelios Capital , Aurelios Convergencia , Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited , would have achieved a majority .
The vote would be 45 % against 37 % .
This is not taken into account by the Court
On the other hand , Vitro is responsible for its difficult situation since 2008 in the context of the great economic crisis in the United States , which gave to the country
For this reason , the González Sada family is opposed to the same appeal court , so that the vote in plenary is held , that is to say all the judges , because only three of them voted
If the case is not granted , the Cerciorn objection to the trial is called for by a higher authority , in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States .
The main concern is that the Court of Justice has sent a document to the government of Mexico , which was set up by the government of the Italian Government , which was described by Vitro , which was described in the Legal Trade Agreement , and which it has to say , that it has strictly complied with the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States &apos; bankruptcy law .
It also states that the country has the principles of the United Nations Commission for international trade , that is to say the rules on the cases of cross-border insolvency , which guarantee equality between debtors and creditors .
Two banquets : a blow for Vitro and for the land .
General Statement
After the Mexican trade unions , which are accused of air traffic to the former owner of the Republic of Azcárraga Andrade , who are accused of a fraudulent administration , have not been forwards , the Asociación Sindical de Pilot Aviadores ( Trade union association ) has finally made progress .
The request by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now been put to the attention of the National Bank and Securities Commission to be accused of the imposition of the judiciary .
The Supervisory Authority has systematically refused to inform the government of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to cancel the contract of trust in the capital exchange of bonds of € 198 million in the name of Mexico , which is the name of Mexico ’ s first bank .
These funds were used to purchase shares of Administradora Profesional de Hoteles ( professional hotel administration ) .
As you know , Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas chain .
Dragon Mart is Melange
At a meeting at a meeting on a meeting held at the weekend , a group of national and foreign environmental protection professionals , academics , entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a wide range of people to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún .
As you know , we are talking about a huge sales and distribution centre in Mexico , Central America and the Caribbean , with products from the country beyond the wall , supplemented by a residential area for employees of 150 companies .
The Canacintra , the national chamber of the processing industry , has reached the southeast to unite the monumental institutions , which devastate protected areas and the mother of all the industrial threats .
ACTA is dead
Because the government has not yet signed up to the question of the Mexican Ambassador to the Republic of Mexico , in which the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement , which is known as the English Abstract , the matter has already been archived in accordance with the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property .
As you know , these measures were taken , although the Senate had taken the opportunity to consider it as a violation of freedom of expression in social networks .

Héctor &apos; Hetin &apos; Reyes : &apos; Basketball was my life &apos;
The world champion of basketball , Héctor &quot; Hetin &quot; Reyes , was a corbsport for more than 60 years and has traveled to the whole world .
Few of Puerto Rico have such a great intellectual collection of the history of the country &apos;s basketball , such as Héctor &apos; Hetin &apos; Reyes
Before joining the wheelchair in 2008 , he was part of this sport , when he was a player of lower classes , players of the first national league , a sponsor and director in BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón , or the president of the basketball band .
&quot; I was on the back of a while , when I was on the basketball , even several , the head of the team , who was the first to be the national team of the national team , and I remembered Reyes when visiting Primera Hora , where he was home to him at Bayamón , where he lives with Isabel , his true wife , who lived for more than 50 years .
&quot; Basketball was my life . &quot;
Reyes does not exaggerate this statement .
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and are testimony to them
Bayamón in the Heart
The most emotional memories are those who , in his time , remember the Vaqueros from the middle of the 50s as a player until 1982 , where he celebrated his 15-year anniversary as a co-manager or manager of the club .
&quot; I have been my best years , I enjoyed most , because I was part of eight masterpieces of the Vaqueros since 1967 as the managing director , co-manager and coach .
They were many enduring years , including the five championships from 1971 to 1975 .
And then I passed with a championship in 1981 , the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy at BSN .
From then on &quot; Cuco &quot; took over , which was a very good administrator , says Reyes .
I know that Gene Bartow , who worked here as a coach and was an apprenticeship at the University of Alabama ( Birmingham ) , said : &quot; I have a very powerful and 2 m large player
Do you want to ?
And this was the beginning of Mincy , one of the best players that Puerto Rico ever had .
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse , the freestyle specialist , and one of our best shipbuilders .
I still know how he said , when Mincy had a championship for Bayamon , he would provide a further one .
The Vaqueros championships were granted to him , but they were out of the way because he was already the top of the association in 1988 .
At that time he preferred to enjoy his full stakes and those of Mincy in the national team .
I still know when we won the World Cup in Mexico against the US for the first time .
Then came the World Championship in 1990 , where we were supposed to have the fourth place , which should have been Bronze , if not this Canadian arbitrator who had the last match for the second time , said Reyes .
Was this group of World Cup in 1990 the best national team you &apos;ve ever seen ?
She is one of the best , as well as those who won the Dream team in 2004 .
But my favourite is the team of the PanAmerican Games in Cuba in 1991 , where we won gold and offered a battle to the US team , as they did when they won a bronze in the World Cup .
The young players , Fico López , Fico López , and the young players ( Javier ) , were also the ones who were playing in the 1990 ’ s .
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities with whom we won a gold medal and which we prepared to offer to us was the one of the pre-Olympic tournaments in 1995 in New Delhi , Argentina .
With players like &quot; Canito &quot; , the young Rolando , and the young Rolando Hourruitiner , we won the Gold medal for the event , because of the events that took place on the PanAmerican Casino in Mar del Plata .
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico ?
That was without doubt Piculín Ortiz .
Its figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive .
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated such a level as Piculín .
And this without taking into account the various leagues in which he played .
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico ?
This is a difficult issue .
We had a number of good trainers such as Julio Toro , Flor Meléndez , Carlos Morales , Raymond Dalmau , Armandito Torres
From the boys , I like the work of Leo Arill .
What do you think the best thing you &apos;ve achieved in the association ?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995 , which allowed BSN to be up to 17 teams in a season in the 1990s .
What remains to be done ?
There are things I have introduced , such as regionalisation of the lower categories .
The guys in Ponce , for example , play in their area , and only in the national playoffs to meet teams from other corners of the island .
Today , children are making unnecessary travel and games .
At least I see the result of the compulsory training and courses for trainer , Tango official and arbitrator .
I am proud of this .
What do you do today ?
I listen to music , watch videos of my time in YouTube , enjoy my grandchildren and go and go to a basketball game .
And , of course , I enjoy the society of my wife Isabel , who has always been my site
Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman was born on 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth Ewing , and was better known as John Ross Ewing , better known as &quot; J.R &quot; in the TV series &quot; Dallas &quot; , where he played a scuneless , homeless and manipulative businessman .
Larry Hagman , whose role as oil magnet J.R. Ewing in the TV series &quot; Dallas &quot; was a symbol of the 80s , is dead .
He was 81 years old .
Hagman , who was born in a new season of &quot; Dallas &quot; , died on Friday afternoon , due to a cancer complications , following a press release by the family at The Associated Press by Warner Bros. , producer of &quot; Dallas &quot; .
&quot; Larry was back in his beloved birthplace of Dallas , where he once again played the iconic role that he liked most , &quot; said the family .
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebration of the harvest .
Linda Gray , who played the role of his wife in the original and torture , was born at Hagman when he died in the hospital of Dallas , she was a journalist Jeffrey Lane .
He made all the joy he knew .
He was creative , generous , fun , fun , lovful and talented , and I will miss him very much .
&quot; He was an original person and lived full of life , &quot; explained Gray in a communication .
Hagman was diagnosed in 1992 and he was a great man to have a lot of fun for years .
In 1995 a malicious tumour was identified in his liver and he was subjecting a transplant .
In the years before &quot; Dallas &quot; Hagman was known on television as a nice type in 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom &quot; Charming Jeannie &quot; of the TV company NBC .
He was born in the city of Kiev , and was a member of the British Empire .
He was also the performer of two comodies that were broadcast only a short time , such as B.The Good Life ( NBC , 1971-72 ) and &quot; Here We Go Again &quot; ( ABC , 1973 ) .
He also performed well evaluated roles in &quot; The Group &quot; , &quot; Harry and Tonto &quot; and &quot; Primary Colors &quot; .
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charming J.R. , who made Hagman a superstar .
The dramatic series of CBS TV series about Ewing-Clan and other figures in their surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991 .
The advertising man , who shocked the expectation of an episode of emotion , where Hagmann was almost killed , led to an international speculation , and millions of dollars were saved in Wetland .
This is why the series reached a record record in this time .
When the answer in a chapter in November 1990 was known , it was seen on an average of 41 million viewers , the &quot; Dallas &quot; in the second most popular entertainment program since the end of &quot; MASH &quot; in 1983 , which had 50 million specimens .
It was Kristin , the weakgerin of J.R. ( interpreting Mary Crosby ) .
He had been wounded and threatened to portray her as prostitutes , if she could not leave the city , but others had reason to see him dead .
Hagman interpreted the role of the Ewing as a corrupt , unsaturated man , with a charismatic smile : a retire businessman and unfaithful husband who then ascribes to his alcohol-cranny Emil ’ s wife ( Linda Gray ) .
&quot; I know what to stand on the tomb of J.R. &quot; , said Hagman 1988 .
It should be hot &quot; Here are the honourable citizens J.R. Ewing &quot; .
This is the only deal that it won .
Victoria Principal , co-leader of the original series , reminded Hagman on Friday to be a &quot; huge personality on and outside the screen &quot; .
He is an unforgettable and unstinted man for millions of scholars , and he has the good fortune to know and love him and to love him .
Ten episodes of the new issue of &quot; Dallas &quot; were broadcast a few months ago in the TV channel TNT .
The recording of five chapters for the second season was closed , and a sixth chapter has just been shot , informed the transmitter .
There was no immediate explanation about how Hagmann was to deal with Hagmann in the series .
Born in Fort Worth , Texas , he was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin , who played classical works such as &quot; South Pacific &quot; and &quot; Peter Pan &quot; .
Martin was a young boy when she was born with lawyer Ben Hagman .
He was his luck at the theater in New York in the 1950s , and he served in the United States in 1952 to 1956 .
He was born in the Netherlands , and was a member of the European Union .
The couple had two children , preston and Heidi , and they lived long time in the Californian city of Malibu , where many celebrities have their residence .
In 2001 he asked his Memoiren &quot; Hello Darlin : Tall ( and Absolute True ) Tales about My Life &quot; .
&quot; I have not written anything that I thought could harm someone or could possibly be affected by it , &quot; said the Associated Press .
After graduation , he started to work for liver donors and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help patients to be sick .
&quot; I beg them , give them courage , I meet with them , if their operations are ahead and then , &quot; he declared in 1996 .
I would like to donate some of them , such as &quot; no fear , it &apos;s a bit uncomfortable the first time , but it will go well &quot; .
He also used smoking and took part in several campaigns .
The beginning of the course that examines the &quot; end of the world &quot;
Every week students study apocalyptic topics such as the atomic war , zombies , virus and buoyancy and global warming .
Every semester , when the religious professor decided to keep a course on the end of the world , he knew that he had an unmistakable : the end of the &quot; long return census &quot; of the Maya calendar on 21 December , which many people believed to be the end of the world .
But Charmé had no idea what he should expect in the following two months : the destructive hurricane Sandy , who has called a few as &quot; Deudarmaggedon &quot; , and a growing conflict with Israel , the place where the Christian theorists believe that the Apocalypse begins .
&quot; I did not realize that this will be the apocalyptic semester that it ever existed &quot; , said Charmé this week the students at the University of Rutgers-Camden ( New Jersey ) .
If anyone analyzes what has happened today in the world , as if we were 30 days away , this would be a really good period .
And he recalls that the evil is good for those with apocalyptic mentality .
And he is not the only professor who should be the only one that is the last in history to offer courses on the &quot; end of the world &quot; .
In Temple , the accompanying professor , Barry Vacker , gives the course &quot; media , culture and the end of the world &quot;
Every week students study apocalyptic topics such as the atomic war , zombies , virus and buoyancy and global warming .
&quot; We analyze why these ideas are spreading with time , &quot; he said , and how to offer hypothetical scenarios that lead to a certain human behavior .
When nuclear material comes into the hands of terrorists , for example , a war could break .
This month , students analyzed movies with apocalyptic content and examined how they compare themselves to real life .
&quot; I tried to inform students about what possible , probably , credible and impossible , &quot; said Vacker .
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania , the Professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari , a cosily professorin for art history and anthropology , a team to offer a course with the simple name &quot; Die end der Welt &quot; .
&quot; We will not be in 2012 to keep the option to keep track of the course , in case the world does not fall &quot; , said Restall .
In spite of the &quot; forthcoming &quot; undergoing , students must study , create projects and participate in auditing .
In Penn State , the final check on the antivirus is carried out , so that students do not have any other chance to continue to work as &quot; until the night , where the world is supposed to end &quot; , said Restall .
The courses were very popular .
&quot; In two hours there were no places more &quot; said Restall , he has his course for students with high average , who met 35 students .
Before midnight , we received e-mails from students asking whether there are still places left .
The students , for their part , assure the most interesting of the course .
&quot; It is fascinating to see what people do to govern themselves , &quot; Bridgid Robinson , a 23-year student in Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology , was born in Haddonfield , New Jersey .
The apocalyptic sectarian or religious culture is , in fact , only a question of troste or lack of its absence
The 25 years student Will Wekesa , for psychology and nurturing , declared all apocalyptic films .
&quot; Nie I heard something about a lesson where he is taught &quot; , he gave .
I enjoy it .
But none of the students asked - and less a professor - declared that the last date of 21 December .
&quot; Our first project treated the Prophecy of Mayas and we discredit them , &quot; said Julie Zeglen , student last year in Temple , 21 years old and from West Chester .
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world ; it is only a key point in the calendar , &quot; Restall .
He notes , however , that in Western society , there is an apocalyptic fear that has taken several centuries to redirect people to change in their surroundings , predicting the end of the world .
The Internet has raised these speculation .
&apos;Other places don &apos;t think people do so &apos; , he says .
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world .
Joseph Dougherty , a religious professor of La Salle University , who is to be taught this year in the Philippines , quickly answers the question of whether he would be familiar with the &quot; end of the world &quot;
&quot; The Philippines are not participating in the World &quot; , he wrote to an exception to a higher authority .
We have a naive from the Pope .
The last thing that was said was that , over the years , many days were spoken , and when on 21 December , there was nothing to say &apos; people immediately thought about a new date &apos; or about the fact that 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period that would end the world .
Students and professors are easily taking this date
Several said that they want to go to celebrate the end of the world .
&apos;Perhaps I call a couple of friends to laugh together , &quot; said Samira Ford , a 20-year student for communications .
