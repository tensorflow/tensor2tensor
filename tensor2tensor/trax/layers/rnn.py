  See combinators.Gate for details on the gating function.


  Args:
    candidate_transform: Transform to apply inside the Candidate branch. Applied
      before nonlinearities.
    memory_transform_fn: Optional transformation on the memory before gating.
    gate_nonlinearity: Function to use as gate activation. Allows trying
      alternatives to Sigmoid, such as HardSigmoid.
    candidate_nonlinearity: Nonlinearity to apply after candidate branch. Allows
      trying alternatives to traditional Tanh, such as HardTanh
    dropout_rate_c: Amount of dropout on the transform (c) gate. Dropout works
      best in a GRU when applied exclusively to this branch.
    sigmoid_bias: Constant to add before sigmoid gates. Generally want to start
      off with a positive bias.

    A model representing a GRU cell with specified transforms.
